INFORMATION ABOUT THE  
Logordo LABS LTD.  
2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (the “Plan”)  
The Company is offering shares of its ordinary shares, US$0.001 par value per share  (the “Ordinary Shares”), to eligible individuals in the Company’s service pursuant to grants of  stock options and other awards under the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to offer the Company’s  employees, certain members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), officers and consultants the  opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in the Company as an incentive for such persons to  continue in the Company’s service. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to the  Company in this document (hereinafter referred to as “Plan Summary”) include Logordo Labs  Ltd. and its parent and subsidiary corporations, whether now existing or subsequently established.  Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the  meanings set forth in the Plan.  
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PLAN  
This Plan Summary sets forth in question-and-answer format the principal terms of the  grants of stock options and other awards that may be made from time to time under the Plan. THE  FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE PLAN ONLY AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE. ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE URGED TO READ THE PLAN  DOCUMENT IN FULL, COPIES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO PERSONS GRANTED AWARDS UNDER THE PLAN, AND ADDITIONAL COPIES ARE  AVAILABLE FROM THE COMPANY UPON REQUEST.  
GENERAL PLAN PROVISIONS  
1. What is the basic structure of the Plan?  
Under the Plan, the Company may grant eligible individuals options that will provide such  individuals with the right to purchase Ordinary Shares at a fixed price per share over a specified  period of time. All options granted under the Plan will vest over a specified period of time. The  Plan also allows for the grant of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other  share-based awards that, may result in the recipient owning Ordinary Shares that are the subject of  vesting restrictions associated with such awards provided for under the Plan until such vesting  restrictions lapse. Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, and Other Share-Based  Awards that may be made under the Plan are collectively referred to as “Awards”.  
2. When was the Plan adopted?  
The Plan was adopted by the Board on January __, 2022.  
3. Who administers the Plan?  
-1-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
The Plan will be administered by the Board or a committee appointed by the Board  composed of at least one member. The Board or committee of the Board that administers the Plan  will be referred to in this document as the “Administrator”.  
The Administrator will have full authority and complete discretion to interpret the Plan and  to determine the persons who are to be granted Awards, the time or times when such Awards are  to be granted, the number of shares to be subject to each such Award, the time or times at which  such Awards may be exercised, the vesting schedule applicable to such Awards and the maximum  periods for which such Awards are to remain outstanding.  
4. Who is eligible to participate in the Plan? 
Employees, leased employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company are  eligible to participate in the Plan. However, the actual persons to whom Awards are to be made  under such program will be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.  
5. How many Ordinary Shares may be issued under the Plan?  
The maximum number of Ordinary Shares issuable over the term of the Plan may not  exceed 5,330,685 shares (subject to adjustment by the Board and the Company’s shareholder).  The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be subject to further adjustment  in the event of a Recapitalization (as described below) and can be increased with requisite approval  from the Board and Company’s shareholders. Should one or more outstanding options granted  under the Plan expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise in full, or should restricted  shares, RSUs, or other share-based awards be canceled, forfeited, or repurchased for any reason,  the Ordinary Shares subject to the portion of such options not so exercised or the portion of such  restricted shares, RSUs, or other share-based awards canceled, forfeited, or repurchased (as the  case may be) will be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. In addition, if any share is  withheld in settlement of a tax withholding obligation associated with an award, or any share is  received by, or surrendered to, the Company in satisfaction of the exercise price payable upon  exercise of an option, that share will become available for grant under the Plan. The Ordinary  Shares will be made available either from authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares or from  Ordinary Shares reacquired by the Company.  
6. What happens if there is a change in the Company’s capital structure?  
In the event of a Recapitalization, subject to any required action by the shareholders of the  Company, appropriate adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of  securities issuable under the Plan (on both an aggregate and per participant basis) and (ii) the  number and/or class of securities and the exercise price per share in effect under each outstanding  option and other Awards. For purposes of this Plan Summary, a “Recapitalization” is generally  any type of stock dividend (which includes any issue of bonus shares), stock split, division of  shares, combination or reclassification of shares, merger, consolidation or other similar type of  change in capitalization.  
7. Can the Plan be amended or terminated?  
-2-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
Yes. The Board has exclusive authority to amend or modify the Plan in any and all  respects. However, no amendment or modification may, without the consent of the holder of an  Award, materially impair such holder’s rights or obligations under his or her outstanding Awards  under the Plan. In addition, certain amendments to the Plan may require approval of the  Company’s shareholders. The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, although no such  termination will materially impair Awards granted prior to such action without consent. The Plan  will terminate when the Board determines to discontinue the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Awards may be amended, modified, or terminated, without consent, to conform with the  requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  In addition, consent will not be required for any modification or amendment of an Incentive Stock  Option that causes that Incentive Stock Option (i) to become a Non-Qualified Stock Option or (ii)  to be considered granted as of the date of such modification or amendment pursuant to Section 424  of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.424-1(e).  
GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS  
8. How are options granted under the Plan?  
 The Administrator will have complete discretion to determine when and to whom options  will be granted and all the terms of each such option. Each option grant will be evidenced by one  or more documents (collectively, the “Option Agreement”) executed by the Company and the  optionee. The Option Agreement will require the optionee to make certain representations and  promises prior to and in connection with the issuance of any shares.  
9. What type of options may be granted under the Plan?  
Incentive stock options (“Incentive Stock Options”) designed to meet the requirements of  Section 422 of the Code, or options that do not satisfy such requirements (“Non-Qualified Stock  Options”) may be granted under the Plan. For a discussion of the difference in tax treatment under  the Code between Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Stock Options , see the “Questions  and Answers on Federal Tax Consequences” section below. Please consult your Option  Agreement to determine whether your options are intended to be Incentive Stock Options or Non 
Qualified Stock Options.  
10. How is the exercise price determined?  
The exercise price of an option will be determined by the Administrator. However (i) no  option granted under the Plan will have an exercise price less than one hundred percent (100%) of  the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares on the date of grant and (ii) no Incentive Stock Option  granted to a “10% Stockholder” (defined as any shareholder owning more than 10% of the voting  power of all classes of shares of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company) will have an  exercise price less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Ordinary  Shares on the grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options may be granted with an exercise  price lower than fair market value on the date of the grant if (i) the options are granted in  assumption or substitution of outstanding awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the  Company or an affiliate or with which the Company or an affiliate combines, or (ii) the options  are otherwise exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code.

DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
11. How is the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares determined?  
Until such time as the Company’s shares are traded on a national market, the fair market  value of the Ordinary Shares will be determined by the Administrator. 
12. Can I assign or transfer my option? 
Unless approved by the Administrator in writing, an option may not be transferred in any  manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution (and subject always to the  requirements of British Virgin Islands law) and may be exercised, during the lifetime of an  optionee, only by the optionee. If the Administrator makes an option transferable, the  Administrator has the authority to make such changes in the applicable options as the  Administrator determines to be appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval  of the Administrator, Non-Qualified Stock Options may be assigned in whole or in part during  your lifetime to one or more members of your immediate family or to a trust established  exclusively for you and/or one or more of your immediate family members or to your former  spouse, to the extent such assignment is in connection with your estate plan or pursuant to a  domestic relations order.  
13. When do I acquire the rights of a shareholder? 
You will not have any shareholder rights with respect to shares subject to stock options.  You will not acquire shareholder rights until you exercise the option, pay the exercise price, the  shares are issued and you become a holder of record in the register of members of the Company  of the purchased shares.  
EXERCISE OF OPTIONS  
14. When may I exercise my option?  
Your option will become exercisable in a series of installments over the period that you  remain in the Company’s service. You may exercise your option at any time for the shares for  which your option is exercisable, provided that you do so before the option terminates. The  exercise schedule applicable to your option will be determined by the Administrator at the time of  grant and will be set forth in the Option Agreement. To the extent provided in your Option  Agreement, you may be able to exercise your options before they have become exercisable under  the exercise schedule (an “Early Exercise”). Shares purchased as a result of an Early Exercise  will be restricted shares (see questions 24 through 28). Your Option Agreement will indicate  whether you have a right to purchase shares through an Early Exercise.  
15. When will my option terminate? 
No option granted under the Plan may have a term in excess of 120 months. The actual  expiration date of your option will be set forth in the Option Agreement. Your option will,  however, terminate prior to its designated expiration date in the event of your termination of  service or upon the occurrence of certain other events. See the “Early Termination of Options”  section below and see your Option Agreement. An Incentive Stock Option granted to a 10%  Stockholder must expire no more than five years after the date of grant.  
-4-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
16. How do I exercise my option? 
To exercise your option, you must provide the Company with written notice of the exercise  stating the number of shares to be purchased under your option. The notice must be accompanied  by payment of the exercise price for the purchased shares, together with appropriate proof that the  person exercising the option (if other than yourself) has the right to effect such exercise. You will  be required to satisfy all applicable income and employment tax withholding requirements at that  time. For information about such tax withholding, see the “Questions and Answers on Federal  Tax Consequences” section below. Also, the Company may require you to enter into one or more  agreements pertaining to your rights as a shareholder as a pre-condition to the exercise of your  option. See the applicable Plan and Option Agreement provisions.  
17. How do I pay the exercise price?  
 The exercise price may be paid in cash or check payable to the Company. The Plan also  provides that the exercise price can be paid via other methods approved by the Administrator in  its sole discretion.  
INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS  
This section applies only to Incentive Stock Options. Non-Qualified Stock Options are not  subject to these provisions.  
18. Who is eligible to receive an Incentive Stock Option? 
Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to individuals who are employees of the  Company.  
19. Is there a limitation on the number of shares for which an Incentive Stock Option may  become exercisable in any one calendar year? 
Yes. The aggregate fair market value of the Ordinary Shares (determined at the date of  grant) for which an option may for the first time become exercisable in any calendar year as an  Incentive Stock Option may not exceed $100,000. To the extent you hold two or more Incentive  Stock Options that become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, the $100,000  limitation will be applied on the basis of the order in which those options were granted. Options  that do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option treatment under the Federal tax laws by reason of  this dollar limitation may nevertheless be exercised as Non-Qualified Stock Options in the calendar  year in which they become exercisable for the excess number of shares.  
20. Can an Incentive Stock Option lose its qualified status?  
Yes. An option granted as an Incentive Stock Option will generally be taxed as a Non Qualified Stock Option if exercised more than three months after your termination of employment  with the Company or if you do not hold the Ordinary Shares for a required holding period (two  years from date of grant and one year from date of exercise). Certain amendments or modifications  to an outstanding option may also cause the loss of Incentive Stock Option status.

EARLY TERMINATION OF OPTIONS  
21. What happens to my options if my service terminates?  
After your termination of service, you will have a limited period of time in which to  exercise your vested outstanding options. The length of this period may depend on the reason for  your termination and, in any event, is described in the Plan and/or Option Agreement and  generally, unless otherwise provided in the Option Agreement, will not exceed ninety (90) days  from the date of termination (and in the event the you reside in the State of California, no less than  thirty (30) days from the date of termination). However, in all events, your option will lapse if not  exercised before the specified expiration of the option term. To the extent not vested, your option  will terminate upon your termination of employment for any reason (unless your Option  Agreement provides otherwise).  
You will be deemed to continue in service for so long as you remain continuously  employed with the Company.  
22. What happens to my options if I die or become disabled?  
If your service with the Company terminates due to your death, the personal representative  of your estate or the person or persons to whom the options are transferred by the provisions of  your will or the laws of inheritance following your death may exercise each of those options for  any or all Ordinary Shares for which the option was exercisable on the date your service with the  Company terminated. Unless otherwise provided in the Option Agreement, the right to exercise  each such option will normally lapse upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the option term or (ii)  12 months following the date of your death (and in the event you reside in the State of California,  no less than 6 months from the date of termination).  
If your service with the Company is terminated because you become permanently disabled  (under the Plan, the term “Disability” means a disability as defined by Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), unless otherwise provided in the Option Agreement you will normally have a period of 12  months following the date of your termination (and in the event you reside in the State of  California, no less than 6 months from the date of termination) during which you may exercise  your options to the extent that they were exercisable upon your termination date. In no event,  however, may you exercise any option after the expiration of the option term.  
23. What happens to my options if the Company is acquired or merged?  
Except as provided in an Option Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, the Board  may in its discretion take one or more of the following actions: (i) cause any or all outstanding  options held by participants affected by the Change in Control to become vested and immediately  exercisable, in whole or in part; (ii) cause any or all outstanding unvested options held by  participants affected by the Change in Control to be cancelled without any consideration therefor;  (iii) require any or all outstanding options held by a participant to be exercised in advance of the  Change in Control and, to the extent not exercised, canceled; (iv) cancel any option in exchange  for a substitute option; (v) cancel any option held by a participant affected by the Change in Control  in exchange for cash and/or other substitute consideration based on the value of the cash and/or  property that would have been received by the participant upon the exercise of the option in the  
-6-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
Change in Control, provided, that if that amount does not exceed the applicable exercise price, the  option will be canceled without any payment of consideration therefor; (vi) condition the right to  receive payment with respect to the options on execution of a release of claims and agreement to  be bound by any definitive transaction document in connection with the Change in Control,; and/or  (vii) take any other action necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of any definitive  agreement controlling the terms and conditions of the Change in Control.  
RESTRICTED SHARES/RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS  
24. What are Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units?  
Restricted shares are Ordinary Shares that are subject to restrictions, generally, over a  period of time. An RSU is the right to receive Ordinary Shares in the future, upon vesting. In  each case, your right to receive unrestricted Ordinary Shares is subject to either a vesting schedule,  a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more service  conditions, or achievement of performance goals or such other objectives as established and  determined by the Administrator. Restricted shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged  or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period or prior to the satisfaction of  any other restrictions prescribed by the Administrator. Likewise, the conditions to which your  RSUs are subject will be set forth by the Administrator in its RSU award agreement delivered to  you.  
25. How are Restricted Shares/Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan?  
 With respect to each participant to whom restricted shares have been granted by the  Company, the Company shall cause its register of members to be updated to reflect such participant  as the holder of those shares and issue, in the name of the participant a share certificate or share  certificates representing the total number of restricted shares granted to such person, as soon as  reasonably practicable after the grant. The Company, at the direction of the Administrator, shall  hold such share certificate or share certificates for the participant’s benefit until such time as the  restricted shares are forfeited to the Company, or the restrictions lapse. 
26. To what rights am I entitled as a holder of Restricted Shares/Restricted Stock Units?  
Your rights with respect to restricted shares and RSUs will be set forth in an Award  Agreement.  
27. What if my employment with the Company terminates prior to the lapse of restrictions  on my Restricted Shares?  
Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by the Administrator in your Award  Agreement, if your relationship with the Company terminates for any reason (including death or  Disability), all restricted shares for which the restrictions have not previously lapsed shall  immediately be forfeited by you, subject to applicable law.  
28. What happens once the restrictions lapse?  
-7-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other  conditions prescribed by the Administrator, the Company shall deliver to you a share certificate  for the number of restricted shares with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed. Share  certificates with respect to RSUs shall be issued when all conditions to which the RSU is subject  have been satisfied.  
OTHER SHARE-BASED AWARDS 
29. What are other share-based awards?  
Other share-based awards are awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in  whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Ordinary Shares. The terms  and conditions to which other share-based awards are subject will be set forth by the Administrator  in the award agreement delivered to you.  
DISPOSITION OF SHARES  
30. When can I sell my shares?  
At the time you become entitled to receive Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Plan, you may  be required to assure the Company that you are willing to hold your shares indefinitely and may  be required to enter into other agreements that limit your right to sell your shares.  
-8-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
MISCELLANEOUS  
31. Do I have the right to remain employed or engaged until my options under the Plan  become exercisable or other Awards vest? 
No. Nothing in the Plan or in any option or other Award granted under the Plan is intended  to provide any person with the right to remain in the Company’s or any of its Affiliate(s)  employment or service for any specific period, and subject to the terms of any agreement to which  you and the Company (or the applicable Affiliate) are a party, both you and the Company (or the  applicable Affiliate) will each have the right to terminate your service at any time and for any  reason, with or without cause.  
32. Are there any circumstances that would cause me to lose my rights with respect to an  option or a share issuance?  
Yes. The grant of options and other Awards under the Plan and the issuance of Ordinary  Shares under the Plan are subject to the Company’s procurement of all approvals and permits  required by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Plan and the securities issuable  thereunder. It is possible that such authorities could prevent the Company from granting options  or from issuing Ordinary Shares under the Plan.  
33. Is the Plan subject to ERISA; is the Plan “qualified” under Section 401(a) of the Code?  
No. The Plan is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) or Section 401(a) of the Code.  
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES  
The following is a general description of the Federal income tax consequences of option  and other Award grants and stock issuances under the Plan. State and local tax treatment, which is  not discussed below, may vary from such Federal income tax treatment. You should consult with  your own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of your particular transactions under the Plan. In  addition, the following description is based upon the Code and existing laws, judicial decisions,  administrative rulings, final and proposed regulations as in effect or existing on the date of this  Plan Summary, all of which are subject to change, and assumes, with respect to any stock option,  that the exercise price per share is no less than one-hundred percent (100%) of fair market value  on the date of grant.  
Nothing contained in this discussion of certain federal income tax considerations is intended or  written to be used, and nothing herein can be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding tax-related  penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing, or recommending to  another party any transactions or tax-related matters addressed herein. 
As described below, the tax consequences of Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified  Stock Options differ.

34. Will the grant of an Incentive Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability to me?  No, not at the time of grant.  
35. Will the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability to  me?  
Generally not for ordinary income tax purposes. You will not recognize ordinary taxable  income at the time the Incentive Stock Option is exercised. However, the amount by which the fair  market value (at the time of exercise) of the purchased shares exceeds the exercise price paid for  those shares will likely constitute an adjustment to your income for purposes of the alternative  minimum tax (see the “Alternative Minimum Tax” section below). Also, if the Incentive Stock  Option is exercised through a “cashless exercise” procedure, a portion of the option may be deemed  disqualified as an Incentive Stock Option and would be taxed as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.  
36. When will I be subject to Federal income tax on shares acquired under an Incentive Stock  Option? 
Generally, you will recognize income in the year in which you make a disposition of the  shares purchased under your Incentive Stock Option.  
37. What constitutes a disposition of Incentive Stock Option shares?  
A disposition of shares purchased under an Incentive Stock Option will occur in the event  you transfer legal title to those shares, whether by sale, exchange or gift, or you deliver such shares  in payment of the exercise price of any other Incentive Stock Option you hold. However, in  general, a disposition will not occur if you engage in any of the following transactions: a transfer  to your spouse, a transfer by bequest or inheritance upon your death or certain tax-free exchanges  of the shares permitted under the Code. A “cashless exercise” of the Incentive Stock Option may  constitute a disposition of Incentive Stock Option shares.  
38. How is my Federal income tax liability determined when I sell my shares?  
Your Federal income tax liability will depend upon whether you make a qualifying or  disqualifying disposition of the shares purchased under your Incentive Stock Option. A qualifying  disposition will occur if the sale or other disposition of the shares takes place more than two years  after the date the Incentive Stock Option was granted and more than one year after the date the  option was exercised for the particular shares involved in the disposition. A disqualifying  disposition is any sale or other disposition made in which either of these minimum holding periods  are not satisfied.  
39. What if I make a qualifying disposition?  
You will recognize a long-term capital gain equal to the excess of (i) the amount realized  upon the sale or disposition over (ii) the exercise price paid for the shares. You will recognize a  long-term capital loss if the amount realized is lower than the exercise price paid for the shares.

Example: On October 1, 2022, you are granted an Incentive Stock Option for 1,000 shares  with an exercise price of $15.00 per share. On November 1, 2024, you exercise this option when  the market price is $25.00 per share. The purchased shares are held until December 1, 2025, when  you sell them for $30.00 per share.  
Because the disposition of the shares is made more than two years after the grant date of  the 2022 Incentive Stock Option and more than one year after the option was exercised for the  shares sold on December 1, 2025, the sale represents a qualifying disposition of such shares, and  for Federal income tax purposes, you will recognize a long-term capital gain of $15.00 per share  (i.e., $30.00 sales price minus $15.00 exercise price).  
40. What are the tax rules for a disqualifying disposition? 
Generally, when you make a disqualifying disposition of shares purchased under an  Incentive Stock Option, you will recognize ordinary income at the time of the disposition in an  amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares on the option exercise date  over (ii) the exercise price paid for those shares. If the disqualifying disposition is effected by  means of an arm’s length sale or exchange with an unrelated party, the ordinary income will be  limited to the amount by which (i) the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares or (ii)  their fair market value on the exercise date, whichever is less, exceeds the exercise price paid for  the shares. Provided that the Company is aware of the disqualifying disposition, the amount of  your disqualifying disposition income will be reported by the Company on your W-2 wage  statement for the year of disposition.  
Any additional gain recognized upon the disqualifying disposition will be long-term capital  gain, if the shares have been held for more than one year following the exercise date of the option.  
Example: On October 1, 2022, you are granted an Incentive Stock Option for 1,000 shares  with an exercise price of $15.00 per share. On November 1, 2024, this option is exercised when  the market price is $25.00 per share. The purchased shares are held until March 1, 2025, when they  are sold for $30.00 per share.  
Because the disposition of the shares is made less than one year after the exercise date of  the 2022 Incentive Stock Option, the sale represents a disqualifying disposition of the shares, and  for Federal income tax purposes, the gain upon the sale will be divided into two components:  
Ordinary Income: You will recognize ordinary income in the amount of $10.00 per share,  the excess of the $25.00 per share market price of the shares on the date the option was exercised  over the $15.00 per share exercise price.  
Capital Gain: You will also recognize a short-term (because the shares were held for one  year or less after exercise) capital gain of $5.00 per share with respect to each share sold ($30.00  sale price less $25.00 fair market value at exercise).  
In the event the shares purchased under an Incentive Stock Option are sold in a  disqualifying disposition for less than the exercise price paid for those shares, you will not  recognize any income but will recognize a capital loss equal to the excess of (i) the exercise price  paid for the shares over (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of those shares. For example,  
-11-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
if the shares in the above example were sold for $13.00 per share in the disqualifying disposition,  you would simply recognize a short-term capital loss of $2.00 per share.  
41. What are the Federal tax consequences to the Company of a disposition of shares?  
If you make a qualifying disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive  Stock Option, then no income tax deduction may be taken by the Company with respect to such  shares. Should you make a disqualifying disposition of such shares, then the Company will be  entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income you recognize in  connection with the disposition. The deduction will, in general, be allowed to the Company in the  taxable year in which the disposition occurs.  
NONSTATUTORY OPTIONS  
42. Will the grant of a Non-Qualified Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability to  me?  
Generally no, not at the time of grant.  
43. Will the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability  to me?  
Normally, you will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the Non-Qualified  Stock Option is exercised in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the  purchased shares on the exercise date over (ii) the exercise price paid for those shares. This income  will be reported by the Company on your W-2 wage statement for the year of exercise (or on a  Form 1099 if you are not an employee), and you will be required to satisfy the tax withholding  requirements applicable to this income.  
44. Will I recognize additional income when I sell shares acquired under a Non-Qualified  Stock Option?  
Yes. You will recognize a capital gain to the extent the amount realized upon the sale of  such shares exceeds their fair market value at the time you recognized the ordinary income with  respect to their acquisition. A capital loss will result to the extent the amount realized upon the  sale is less than such fair market value. The gain or loss will be long-term if the shares are held for  more than one year prior to the disposition and short-term if the shares are held for one year or  less. The holding period normally starts at the time the Non-Qualified Stock Option is exercised.  
45. What are the consequences of paying the exercise price of a Non-Qualified Stock Option  in the form of Ordinary Shares previously acquired upon the exercise of employee options  or through open-market purchases?  
You will not recognize any taxable income to the extent the Ordinary Shares received upon  the exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Option equal in number the Ordinary Shares delivered in  payment of the exercise price. For Federal income tax purposes, these newly-acquired shares will  have the same basis and capital gain holding period as the delivered shares. To the extent the  delivered shares were acquired under an Incentive Stock Option, the new shares received upon the  
-12-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Option will continue to be subject to taxation as Incentive  Stock Option shares in accordance with the Incentive Stock Option principles discussed above.  
The additional Ordinary Shares received upon the exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock  Option will, in general, have to be reported as ordinary income for the year of exercise in an amount  equal to their fair market value on the exercise date. These additional shares will have a tax basis  equal to such fair market value and a capital gain holding period measured (in general) from the  exercise date.  
46. What are the Federal tax consequences to the Company of the exercise of a Non-Qualified  Stock Option?  
The Company will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary  income you recognize in connection with the exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Option. The  deduction will, in general, be allowed for the taxable year of the Company in which you recognize  such ordinary income.  
OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS  
47. What additional factors should I consider if I am granted Restricted Stock?  
With respect to restricted shares, you may file an election with the Internal Revenue  Service, within 30 days of the receipt of the shares, electing pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code  (“83(b) Election”) to be taxed currently on the value of the shares on the date of purchase, less the  amount paid (if any). This will result in a recognition of taxable income to you on the date of the  election; however, any further appreciation will be capital in nature. In the event the value  declines, or in the event that your restricted shares are forfeited or do not vest, you will not be  entitled to an ordinary loss, however. If you do not file an 83(b) election, at the expiration of the  restriction period and the satisfaction of the forfeiture restrictions applicable to the restricted  shares, you will recognize ordinary income, and the Company will generally be entitled to a  corresponding deduction, equal to the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares at that time less the  amount paid (if any) for such shares.  
48. What are the tax consequences if I am granted RSUs? 
 You will generally recognize ordinary income as and when the Ordinary Shares subject to the  RSUs are issued you, in an amount equal to the fair market value of our Ordinary Shares issued  (plus the amount (if any) of any cash received). The Company will generally be entitled to a  corresponding tax deduction at such time. You may not make a Section 83(b) Election upon  receipt of a restricted stock unit award. 
49. What are the tax consequences if I am granted other share-based awards? 
The federal income tax consequences of other share-based awards will depend on the terms  and conditions of those awards but, in general, you will be required to recognize ordinary income  in an amount equal to the cash and the fair market value of any fully vested shares of our Ordinary  Shares paid, determined at the time of such payment, in connection with such Awards. The  
-13-

Company normally will be entitled to a deduction at the time when, and in the amount that, you  recognize ordinary income.

Subject to the requirements of the Memorandum and Articles,  any Stockholders Agreement and any other agreement that governs the appointment of Board  committees, any Committee established under this Section 2 will be composed of not fewer than  one member, who shall serve for such period of time as the Board determines. From time to time  the Board may increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members thereto, remove  members (with or without Cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill vacancies  however caused, or remove all members of the Committee and thereafter directly administer the  Plan.  
(b) If and to the extent permitted by law, the Board may (i) authorize one or  more officers of the Company to make Awards to officers and employees of the Company and its  Subsidiaries and/or (ii) delegate administrative functions with respect to the Plan and Awards to  individuals who are officers or employees of the Company or its Affiliates.  
(c) Directors who are eligible for Awards or have received Awards may vote  on any matters affecting the administration of the Plan or the grant of Awards, except that to the  extent prohibited by applicable law no such member will act upon the grant of an Award to himself  or herself, but any such member may be counted in determining the existence of a quorum at any  meeting of the Board during which action is taken with respect to the grant of Awards to himself  or herself.  
(d) The Board will have full authority to grant Awards under this Plan. In  particular, subject to the terms of the Plan, the Board will have the authority:  
(i) to select the persons to whom Awards may from time to time be  
granted hereunder (consistent with the eligibility conditions set forth in Section 4);  
(ii) to determine the type of Award to be granted to any person  
hereunder;  
(iii) to determine the number and type of Shares, if any, to be covered by  
each Award;  
(iv) to establish the terms and conditions of each Award Agreement;  
-7-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
(v) to determine whether and under what circumstances an Option may 
be exercised without a payment of cash under Section 5(b)(iv);  
(vi) to adopt special guidelines and provisions for Persons who are  
residing in or employed in, or subject to, the taxes of, any domestic or foreign jurisdictions  to comply with or as otherwise advisable under applicable laws of such domestic or foreign  jurisdictions, including, without limitation, tax and securities laws;  
(vii) to determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances  
Shares and other amounts payable with respect to an Award may be deferred either  automatically or at the election of the Participant;  
(viii) to amend any outstanding Awards, including, without limitation, for  
the purpose of modifying the time or manner of vesting, or the term of any outstanding  Award; provided, however, that if any such amendment materially impairs a Participant’s rights or increases a Participant’s obligation under his or her Award, such amendment shall  also be subject to the Participant’s consent;  
(ix) to accelerate the time at which an Award may first be exercised or  
the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in accordance with the Plan,  notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating the time at which it may first be  exercised or the time during which it will vest; and  
(x) to require that, upon exercise of any Award granted under the Plan,  
the Participant shall become party to (X) any Stockholder Agreement the Board may  require and (Y) any other agreement the Board may require.  
(e) The Board will have the authority to adopt, alter and repeal such  administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan as it, from time to time, deems  advisable; to establish the terms of each Award Agreement; to interpret the terms and provisions  of the Plan and any Award issued under the Plan (and any Award Agreement); and to otherwise  supervise the administration of the Plan. The Board may correct any defect, supply any omission  or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award in the manner and to the extent it deems  necessary to carry out the intent of the Plan.  
(f) All decisions made by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Plan will  be final and binding on all persons, including, without limitation, the Company, its Affiliates and  Participants. No Director or member of the Committee, nor any delegate thereof, shall be liable  for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in  connection with the Plan, and each of the foregoing shall be entitled in all cases to indemnification  and reimbursement by the Company in respect of any claim, loss, damage or expense (including,  without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising or resulting therefrom to the fullest extent  permitted by law and/or under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage which may  be in effect from time to time.  
SECTION 3. Shares Subject to the Plan.  
-8-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
(a) Shares Subject to the Plan. The Shares to be subject to or related to Awards  under the Plan will be authorized and unissued Shares of the Company and Shares that are held as  Treasury Shares. Subject to Sections 3(b) and 3(c) hereof, the maximum number of Shares that  may be subject to Awards under the Plan is 5,330,685 all of which may be issued in respect of  Incentive Stock Options. The Company will reserve for the purposes of the Plan, out of its  authorized and unissued Shares, such number of Shares.  
(b) Effect of the Expiration or Termination of Awards. If and to the extent that  an Option expires, terminates or is canceled or forfeited for any reason without having been  exercised in full, the Shares associated with that Option shall again become available for grant  under the Plan. Similarly, if and to the extent any Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit or Other  Share-Based Award is canceled, forfeited or repurchased for any reason, the Shares so canceled,  forfeited or repurchased shall again become available for grant under the Plan. If any Share is  withheld pursuant to Section 16(f) in settlement of a tax withholding obligation associated with an  Award, that Share will again become available for grant under the Plan. Finally, if any Share is  received by, or surrendered to, the Company in satisfaction of the exercise price payable upon  exercise of an Option, that Share will become available for grant under the Plan. This Section 3(b)  shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.  
(c) Other Adjustment. Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the  Company, the number and type of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the number  and type of Shares that are authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have  yet been granted (including Shares of previously granted Awards that are available for new grants  pursuant to Section 3(c)), shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the  number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, division of shares, reverse stock split,  combination of shares, stock dividend, issue of bonus shares or reclassification of the Ordinary  Shares, merger, consolidation, or other similar type of change in capitalization, or any other  increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by  the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company  shall not be deemed to have been “effected without receipt of consideration.” Such adjustment  shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and  conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any  class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason  thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award hereunder.  With respect to any Award subject to Section 409A of the Code or could be subject to 409A, no  such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment would cause the Plan or  Award to fail to comply with Section 409A or an exemption thereunder.  
(d) Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  the Plan, upon or in anticipation of any Change in Control, the Board may, in its sole and absolute  discretion and without the need for the consent of any Participant, take one or more of the following  actions contingent upon the occurrence of that Change in Control: (i) cause any or all outstanding  Options held by Participants affected by the Change in Control to become vested and immediately  exercisable, in whole or in part; (ii) cause any or all outstanding unvested Options held by  Participants affected by the Change in Control to be cancelled without any consideration therefor;  
-9-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
(iii) require any or all outstanding Options held by a Participant to be exercised in advance of the  Change in Control and, to the extent not exercised, canceled; (iv) cause any or all Restricted Stock,  Restricted Stock Units or Other Share-Based Awards held by Participants affected by the Change  in Control to become non-forfeitable, in whole or in part; (v) cancel any Option in exchange for a  substitute option in a manner consistent with the requirements of Treas. Reg. §1.424-1(a)  (notwithstanding the fact that the original Option may never have been intended to satisfy the  requirements for treatment as an Incentive Stock Option); (vi) cancel any Restricted Stock,  Restricted Stock Units or Other Share-Based Award held by a Participant affected by the Change  in Control in exchange for restricted stock of, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards in  respect of, the capital stock of any successor corporation; (vii) redeem any Restricted Stock held  by a Participant affected by the Change in Control for the “Change in Control Consideration” (as  defined below); (viii) cancel any Option held by a Participant affected by the Change in Control  in exchange for cash and/or other substitute consideration with a value, subject to Section 3(e)  hereof, equal to (A) the number of Shares subject to that Option, multiplied by (B) the excess, if  any, of the Change in Control Consideration per Share over the exercise price per Share of that  Option; provided, that if the Change in Control Consideration per Share does not exceed the  exercise price of any such Option, the Option shall be canceled without any payment of  consideration therefor; (ix) cancel any Restricted Stock Unit or Other Share-Based Award held by  a Participant affected by the Change in Control in exchange for cash and/or other substitute  consideration with a value equal to, subject to Section 3(e) hereof, the Change in Control  Consideration per Share on the date of the Change in Control; (x) condition the right to receive  payment with respect to Awards on execution of a release of claims in a form furnished by the  Company and agreement to be bound by any definitive transaction document in connection with  the Change in Control, including being subject to any escrow, holdback, indemnification  obligation and appointment of an escrow agent or seller/shareholder representative; and/or (xi)  take any other action necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of any definitive agreement  controlling the terms and conditions of the Change in Control. The Board shall not be required to  treat all outstanding Awards held by Participants or all Awards held by a single Participant  similarly. For purposes of the foregoing, “Change in Control Consideration” means with respect  to any Change in Control, the value, subject to Section 3(e) below, of cash and/or property that  would have been received by a Participant upon the exercise of, or realization of the Participant’s  rights with respect to, an Award upon the consummation of the Change in Control, as determined  by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion.  
(e) Additional Requirements. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan  or in an Award Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control, each Participant  shall, except to the extent otherwise determined by the Board, be subject to substantially the same  escrow, indemnification and similar obligations, contingencies and encumbrances contained in the  definitive agreement relating to the Change in Control as other holders of shares may be subject  (including, without limitation, the requirement to contribute a proportionate number of Shares,  cash or property to an escrow fund, or otherwise have a proportionate amount of such Shares, cash  or other property encumbered by the indemnification, escrow and similar provisions of such  definitive agreement). By accepting an Award, a Participant agrees to execute such documents  and instruments as the Board may require for the Participant to be bound by such obligations. In  the event that a Participant fails or refuses to execute such documents and instruments, such  
-10-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
Participant’s Award (to the extent outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control) shall, unless  otherwise determined by the Board, be canceled without payment of consideration and be of no  further force and effect upon the consummation of a Change in Control.  
SECTION 4. Eligibility. All Service Providers are eligible to be granted  Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that only employees of the Company or a Subsidiary  are eligible to be granted Incentive Stock Options and, provided, further, that any Award granted  to any prospective Service Provider shall be subject to such Service Provider’s commencement of  employment or service with the Company or any of its Affiliates, and shall not be effective prior  to such commencement. The Board’s determinations under the Plan (including, without limitation,  determinations of which persons are to receive Awards and in what amount) need not be uniform.  
SECTION 5. Options.  
(a) Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive Stock  Options or (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options. Any Option granted under the Plan will be in such  form as the Board may at the time of such grant approve. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  Company shall have no liability to any Participant or other person if an Option designated as an  Incentive Stock Option fails to qualify as such at any time.  
(b) The Award Agreement evidencing an Option will incorporate the following  terms and conditions and will contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with  the terms of the Plan, as the Board deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion:  
(i) Option Price. The exercise price per Share purchasable under an  
Option will be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of the grant;  provided, however, that any Incentive Stock Option granted to any Participant who, at the time the  Option is granted, owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company  or of a Subsidiary will have an exercise price per Share of not less than 110% of Fair Market Value  per Share on the date of the grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with  an exercise price lower than Fair Market Value on the date of the grant if (x) such Option is a  Substitute Award, subject to the requirements of Section 409A and, with respect to Incentive Stock  Options Section 424(a) of the Code, or (y) such Option is otherwise exempt from or compliant  with Section 409A.  
(ii) Option Term. The term of each Option will be fixed by the Board,  
but no Option will be exercisable more than ten (10) years after the date the Option is granted.  However, any Incentive Stock Option granted to any Participant who, at the time such Option is  granted, owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or of a  Subsidiary may not have a term of more than five years. No Option may be exercised by any  person after expiration of the term of the Option.  
(iii) Exercisability. Options will vest and be exercisable at such time or  
times and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant. If  the Board provides, in its sole and absolute discretion, that any Option is exercisable only in  
-11-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
installments, the Board may waive such installment exercise provisions at any time at or after  grant, in whole or in part, based on such factors as the Board determines, in its sole and absolute  discretion. Except to the extent required by applicable law, upon action by the Board in its sole  and absolute discretion, vesting of Options may be tolled during a Participant’s leave of absence,  effective as of the date the leave commenced.  
(iv) Method of Exercise. Subject to the exercisability provisions of this  
Section 5(b)(iv), the termination provisions set forth in Section 6 and the applicable Award  Agreement, Options may be exercised in whole or in part (provided that the Company shall not be  required to issue fractional shares) at any time and from time to time during the term of the Option,  by the delivery of written notice of exercise by the Participant to the Company specifying the  number of Shares to be purchased, the election to exercise, and such other representations and  provisions as may be required by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. The Board may  limit how frequently Participants may exercise Options. The Board shall determine whether cash,  additional Awards or other securities or property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional  Ordinary Shares or whether any fractional shares should be rounded, forfeited or otherwise  eliminated.  
(v) Method of Payment. A notice of exercise delivered by a Participant  
to the Company must be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, which may be by  any of the following (or a combination thereof): (i) cash; (ii) certified or bank check; (iii) subject  to the approval of the Board, promissory note having such terms as the Board may, in its sole  discretion, permit; (iv) subject to approval of the Board, a recourse interest bearing note secured  by all of outstanding equity held by Participant; (v) subject to the approval of the Board, by  surrender of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the purchase price;  (vi) subject to the approval of the Board, by surrendering Shares issuable upon the exercise of the  Option having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the purchase price; (vii) if the  Shares are traded on a stock exchange, national market system or in the over-the-counter market,  pursuant to such cashless exercise procedures as may be approved and implemented by the Board  from time to time, including, without limitation, pursuant to broker-assisted exercise transactions  and/or net exercise procedures; or (viii) such other means as the Board may permit. No Shares  will be issued upon exercise of an Option until full payment therefor has been made. Unless  otherwise specifically provided by the Board, the exercise price that is paid by the transfer to the  Company of other Ordinary Shares acquired, directly or indirectly from the Company, shall be  paid only with Shares that have been held for more than six months (or such longer or shorter  period of time required to avoid a charge to earnings for financial accounting purposes). A  Participant will not have the right to distributions or dividends or any other rights of a shareholder  with respect to Shares subject to the Option until the Participant has given written notice of  exercise, has paid in full for such Shares, and, if requested, has given the representation described  in SECTION 16 hereof.  
(vi) Tax Withholding. Upon exercise of an Option, the Company shall 
have the right to require a Participant to remit to the Company cash in an amount sufficient to  satisfy all applicable Federal and state tax withholding requirements (or to make other provision  for tax withholding requirements as permitted by the Plan and by applicable law). In the event a  
-12-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
Participant disputes the amount withheld or required to be withheld, Participant’s sole recourse  shall be to seek a refund from the applicable tax authority. To the extent permitted by applicable  law, the Company can withhold any taxes owed from future payments to Participant.  
(vii) Early Exercise of Unvested Option. If permitted by an Award  
Agreement or the Board, an outstanding Option, to the extent it is not yet exercisable, may be  exercised subject to the Participant’s payment of the applicable exercise price in the manner  permitted under Section 5(b)(iv) above and the Participant’s execution of a restricted stock  purchase agreement having such terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan  as may be determined by the Board in its sole discretion. Unless the Board determines otherwise,  the restricted stock purchase agreement shall grant the Company a right to repurchase the Shares  acquired by the Participant as a result of exercise of the Option upon the Participant’s separation  from service with the Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The purchase price  for the unvested Shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to the restricted stock purchase  agreement shall be the lesser of (i) original purchase price paid for the Shares by the Participant,  and (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the date of the repurchase. Such purchase price  may be paid cash payment or by cancellation of any indebtedness of the Participant to the  Company. During the period of the restrictions set forth in the restricted stock purchase agreement,  the Shares acquired by the Participant upon exercise of the Option shall be treated as Restricted  Stock under the Plan.  
(viii) Incentive Stock Option Limitations. In the case of an Incentive  
Stock Option, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the Shares  with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant  during any calendar year under the Plan and/or any other plan of the Company or any Parent or  Subsidiary will not exceed $100,000. For purposes of applying the foregoing limitation, Incentive  Stock Options will be taken into account in the order granted. To the extent any Option does not  meet such limitation, that Option will be treated for all purposes as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.  
(ix) Disqualifying Disposition. Any Participant who makes a  
"disposition" (as defined in Section 424 of the Code) of all or any portion of Ordinary Shares  acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within two years from the grant date of such  Incentive Stock Option or within one year after the issuance of the Shares acquired upon exercise  of such Incentive Stock Option (a “Disqualifying Disposition”) shall be required to immediately  advise the Company in writing as to the occurrence of the sale and the price realized upon the sale  of such Shares.  
(x) Termination of Service. Unless otherwise specified in the  
applicable Award Agreement, Options will be subject to the terms of Section 6 with respect to  exercise upon or following termination of employment or other service.  
(xi) Transferability of Options. Except as may otherwise be specifically  
determined by the Board with respect to a particular Option: (i) no Option (including, without  limitation, any economic right therein or related thereto including, but not limited to, any swap,  forward, future or other financial derivative that derives its value from or by reference to the Shares  
-13-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
underlying such Option) will be transferable by the Participant other than by will or by the laws of  descent and distribution, and any such purported transfer shall be null and void ab initio; and (ii)  all Options will be exercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant or, in the  event of his or her Disability, by his or her personal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  subject to approval of the Board, a Non-Qualified Stock Option may be assigned in whole or in  part during the Participant’s lifetime to one or more members of the Participant’s Immediate  Family (as defined in the Memorandum and Articles) or to a trust established exclusively for the  Participant and/or one or more such family members or to Participant’s former spouse (including,  without limitation, any domestic partner or partner by virtue of same-sex marriage and/or civil  union), to the extent such assignment is in connection with the Participant’s estate plan or pursuant  to a domestic relations order. The assigned portion may only be exercised by the person or persons  who acquire a proprietary interest in the Non-Qualified Stock Option pursuant to the assignment.  If such assignment or transfer is permitted, a Participant shall be required to (i) make such  representations and warranties as the Company may require in its sole and absolute discretion and  (ii) enter into such agreements related to the transfer as the Company may require in its sole and  absolute discretion.  
SECTION 6. Termination of Service. Unless otherwise specified with  respect to a particular Award, Options granted hereunder will remain exercisable after termination  of employment or other service only to the extent specified in this Section 6.  
(a) Termination by Reason of Death. If a Participant’s service with the  Company or any of its Affiliates terminates by reason of death, any Option held by such Participant  may thereafter be exercised, to the extent then exercisable or on such accelerated basis as the Board  may determine, at or after grant, by the legal representative of the estate or by the delegate of the  Participant under the will of the Participant for a period expiring (i) at such time as may be  specified by the Board at or after the time of grant (which, in the event that the Participant resides  in the state of California, shall be no less than six (6) months from the date of termination), or (ii)  if not specified by the Board, then twelve (12) months from the date of death, or (iii) if sooner than  the applicable period specified under (i) or (ii) above, then upon the expiration of the stated term  of such Option.  
(b) Termination by Reason of Disability. If a Participant’s service with the  Company or any of its Affiliates terminates by reason of Disability, any Option held by such  Participant may thereafter be exercised by the Participant or his or her personal representative, to  the extent it was exercisable at the time of termination, or on such accelerated basis as the Board  may determine at or after grant, for a period expiring (i) at such time as may be specified by the  Board at or after the time of grant (which, in the event that the Participant resides in the state of  California, shall be no less than six (6) months from the date of termination), or (ii) if not specified  by the Board, then twelve (12) months from the date of termination of service, or (iii) if sooner  than the applicable period specified under (i) or (ii) above, then upon the expiration of the stated  term of such Option.  
(c) Cause. If a Participant’s service with the Company or any Affiliate is  terminated for Cause or a determination is made by the Board that the Participant engaged in  
-14-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
conduct that would be grounds for a termination for Cause (whether or not the Participant’s service  relationship is terminated for Cause or such Participant resigns prior to such determination), then  (i) any outstanding Option shall thereupon be forfeited (in any manner of forfeiture chosen by the  Company in its discretion as determined by the Board), and (ii) any Shares issued to the Participant  concerned which are subject to restrictions under this Plan and/or the applicable Award Agreement  will be forfeited and the Company will refund to the Participant the Option exercise price paid for  such Shares, if any. 
(d) Transfer; Approved Leave of Absence. For purposes of the Plan, no  termination of employment by an employee shall be deemed to result from either (i) a transfer of  employment to the Company from an Affiliate or from the Company to an Affiliate, or from one  Affiliate to another, or (ii) an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any  other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed  either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was  granted or if the Board otherwise so provides in writing, in either case, except to the extent  inconsistent with Section 409A of the Code if the applicable Award is subject thereto.  
(e) Other Termination. If a Participant’s service with the Company or any  Affiliate terminates for any reason other than death, Disability or Cause, any Option held by such  Participant may thereafter be exercised by the Participant, to the extent it was exercisable at the  time of such termination, or on such accelerated basis as the Board may determine at or after grant,  for a period expiring (i) at such time as may be specified by the Board at or after the time of grant  (which, in the event that the Participant resides in the state of California, shall be no less than thirty  (30) days from the date of termination), or (ii) if not specified by the Board, then ninety (90) days  from the date of termination of service or (iii) if sooner than the applicable period specified under  (i) or (ii) above, then upon the expiration of the stated term of such Option.  
SECTION 7. Restricted Stock.  
(a) Issuance. Restricted Stock may be issued either alone or in conjunction  with other Awards. The Board will determine the time or times within which Restricted Stock  may be subject to forfeiture, and all other conditions of such Awards.  
(b) Awards and Certificates. The Award Agreement evidencing the grant of  any Restricted Stock will contain such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the  Plan, as the Board deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. The purchase price for  Restricted Stock may, but need not, be for a consideration involving no payment of any money.  Subject to Section 16(g) of the Plan, one or more share certificates will be issued in connection  with each Award of Restricted Stock. Such certificate will be registered in the name of the  Participant receiving the Award, and will bear the following legend and/or any other legend  required by this Plan, the Award Agreement, Stockholders Agreement, if any, or by applicable  law:  
THE TRANSFERABILITY OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND  
THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO  
-15-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE Logordo  
LABS LTD. 2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AND AN  
AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE  
PARTICIPANT AND Logordo LABS LTD. (WHICH  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY INCLUDE, WITHOUT  
LIMITATION, CERTAIN TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS,  
REPURCHASE RIGHTS AND FORFEITURE  
CONDITIONS). COPIES OF THAT PLAN AND  
AGREEMENT ARE ON FILE IN THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES  
OF Logordo LABS LTD. AND WILL BE MADE  
AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE  
WITHOUT CHARGE UPON REQUEST TO THE  
DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY.  
Share certificates evidencing Restricted Stock will be held in custody by the Company or by an  escrow agent until the restrictions thereon have lapsed. As a condition to any Restricted Stock  Award, the Participant may be required to deliver to the Company an instrument of transfer relating  to the Shares covered by such Award in such manner as the Company may determine.  
(c) Restrictions and Conditions. Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this  Section 7 will be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:  
(i) During a period commencing with the date of an Award of  
Restricted Stock and ending at such time or times as specified by the Board (the “Restriction  Period”), the Participant will not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise  encumber Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan or any economic right therein or related thereto  (including, but not limited to, any swap, forward, future or other financial derivative that derives  its value from or by reference to such Restricted Stock). The Board may condition the lapse of  restrictions on Restricted Stock upon the continued employment or service of the recipient, the  attainment of specified individual or corporate performance goals, or such other factors or criteria  as the Board may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion.  
(ii) Except as provided in this Paragraph (ii) or Section 7(c)(i), once a  
Participant has been entered in the Register of Members as the holder of Shares that are Restricted  Stock and issued a certificate or certificates for Restricted Stock (or a Participant’s ownership of  Restricted Stock has otherwise been evidenced pursuant to Section SECTION 16(g) hereof), the  Participant will have, with respect to the Restricted Stock, all of the rights of a shareholder of the  Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote the Shares, and the right to receive any  cash distributions or dividends. The Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, as determined at  the time of award, may permit or require the payment of cash distributions or dividends to be  deferred and, if the Board so determines, reinvested in additional Restricted Stock to the extent  Shares are available under Section 3 of the Plan. Any distributions or dividends paid in the form  of securities with respect to Restricted Stock will be subject to the same terms and conditions as  the Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid, including, without limitation, the same  Restriction Period.  
-16-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
(iii) Subject to the applicable provisions of the Award Agreement, if a  
Participant’s service with the Company and its Affiliates terminates prior to the expiration of the  Restriction Period, all of that Participant’s Restricted Stock which then remain subject to forfeiture  will then be subject to forfeiture by the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, in such manner of  forfeiture as the Company in its absolute discretion may elect) without payment of consideration  therefor.  
(iv) If and when the Restriction Period expires without a prior forfeiture  
of the Restricted Stock subject to such Restriction Period (or if and when the restrictions applicable  to Restricted Stock lapse pursuant to Section 3(d)), any certificates for such Shares will be replaced  with new certificates, without the restrictive legends described in Section 7(b) applicable to such  lapsed restrictions, and the Company (or its delegate) will subject to the payment of any applicable  fees required by the administrator of the Plan:  
(A) upon the Participant’s request or the request of the Participant’s  
representative (if the Participant has suffered a Disability) provide such new certificates to  the Participant or the Participant’s representative (as applicable); or  
(B) upon the request of such other person as has been recorded in  
the Register of Members as the holder of such Restricted Stock following the death of the  Participant provide such new certificates to the person so recorded on the Register of  Members.  
SECTION 8. Restricted Stock Units. Subject to the other terms of the Plan,  the Board may grant Restricted Stock Units to eligible individuals and may impose conditions on  such units as it may deem appropriate. Each granted Restricted Stock Unit shall be evidenced by  an Award Agreement in the form that is approved by the Board and that is not inconsistent with  the terms and conditions of the Plan. Each granted Restricted Stock Unit shall entitle the  Participant to whom it is granted a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the Fair  Market Value (at the time of the distribution) of one Share. Distributions may be made in cash,  Shares or a combination of cash and Shares or in such other manner as may be permitted by the  Memorandum and Articles. All other terms governing Restricted Stock Units, such as vesting,  time and form of payment and termination of units shall be set forth in the Award Agreement. To  the extent provided in an Award Agreement, the holder of Restricted Stock Units may be entitled  to be credited with dividend equivalent payments (upon the payment by the Company of dividends  on Shares or issue of bonus shares) either in cash or, at the sole and absolute discretion of the  Board, in Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends or issue of  bonus shares (and interest may, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board, be credited on the  amount of cash dividend equivalents at a rate and subject to such terms as provided by the Board),  which accumulated dividend equivalent amounts shall be payable to the Participant upon the  vesting of the Restricted Stock Units to which such dividend equivalent amounts relate, and to the  extent such Restricted Stock Units are forfeited, the related dividend equivalent amounts shall be  forfeited.

SECTION 9. Other Share-Based Awards. The Board is authorized, subject  to limitations under applicable law and the other terms of the Plan, to grant to eligible Persons  under Section 4, such other Awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in  part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Shares (including, without limitation,  stock or share appreciation rights and/or unrestricted Ordinary Shares), as deemed by the Board to  be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. Each Award granted pursuant to this Section 9 (other  than, in the discretion of the Board, an award of unrestricted Ordinary Shares) shall be evidenced  by an Award Agreement in the form that is approved by the Board and that is not inconsistent with  the terms and conditions of the Plan. 
SECTION 10. Amendments and Termination. The Board may amend, alter  or discontinue the Plan at any time. However, except as otherwise provided in Section 3(d) of the  Plan, no amendment, alteration or discontinuation will be made which would materially impair the  rights of a Participant with respect to an Award, without that Participant’s consent, or which,  without the approval of such amendment within one year (365 days) of its adoption by the Board,  by the Company’s shareholders in a manner consistent with Section 1.422-5 of the Treasury  Regulations, would: (i) increase the total number of Shares reserved for the purposes of the Plan  (except as otherwise provided in Section 3(c)), or (ii) change the persons or class of persons  eligible to receive Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of the Plan or an  Award to the contrary, (i) the Board may at any time (without the consent of a Participant) modify,  amend or terminate any or all of the provisions of this Plan or an Award to the extent necessary to  conform the provisions of the Plan or an Award with Section 409A of the Code other applicable  law, the regulations issued thereunder or an exception thereto, regardless of whether such  modification, amendment, or termination of the Plan and/or Award shall adversely affect the rights  of a Participant, and (ii) no modification or amendment of any Incentive Stock Option shall require  the Participant’s consent as a result of such modification or amendment causing such Incentive  Stock Option (A) to become a Non-Qualified Stock Option or (B) to be considered granted as of  the date of such modification or amendment pursuant to Section 424 of the Code and Treasury  Regulations Section 1.424-1(e). No course of conduct or course of dealing or failure or delay by  the Company or any of its Affiliates (or any employee, officer, director or Consultant of the  Company or any of its Affiliates) in enforcing or exercising any of the provisions of this Plan or  any Award will affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Plan or any Award or be  deemed to be an implied waiver of any provision of the Plan or any Award. Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, following a termination of the Plan, with respect to Shares then  outstanding that were issued pursuant to Awards thereunder, Sections 11, 12 and 13 shall continue  in effect until and shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the consummation of the  Company’s first underwritten Public Offering of its Ordinary Shares (other than a registration  statement relating either to the sale of securities to employees of the Company pursuant to its stock  option, stock purchase or similar plan or an SEC Rule 145 transaction) and (b) the consummation  of a Change in Control and, in the case of Section 11 only, the distribution of proceeds to or escrow  for the benefit of the Company’s shareholders in accordance with the Company’s certificate of  incorruption in effect at such time; provided that the provisions of Section 11 shall continue after  the closing of any Change in Control to the extent necessary to enforce the provisions of Section 11  with respect to such Change in Control.

SECTION 11. Drag-Along Right; Irrevocable Proxy and Power of  
Attorney  
(a) Actions to be Taken. In the event that the holders of outstanding shares of  the Company representing at least a majority of the votes of the outstanding shares of the Company  (voting together on an as-converted to Ordinary Shares basis) (the “Electing Holders”) approve  a Change in Control in writing, specifying that this Section 11 shall apply to such transaction, then,  subject to satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Section 11(b) below, each Participant  and the Company hereby agree:  
(i) if such transaction requires shareholder approval, with respect to all  
Shares that such Participant owns or over which such Participant otherwise exercises  voting power, to vote (in person, by proxy or by action by written consent, as applicable)  all Shares in favor of, and adopt, such Change in Control (together with any related  amendment or restatement to the Memorandum and Articles then in effect required to  implement such Change in Control) and to vote in opposition to any and all other proposals  that could reasonably be expected to delay or impair the ability of the Company to  consummate such Change in Control;  
(ii) if such transaction is a Stock Sale, to sell the same proportion of  
shares of the Company beneficially held by such Participant as is being sold by the Electing  Holders to the Person to whom the Electing Holders propose to sell their Shares, and,  except as permitted in Section 11(a), on the same terms and conditions as the other  shareholders of the Company;  
(iii) to execute and deliver all related documentation and take such  
other action in support of the Change in Control as shall reasonably be requested by the  Company or the Electing Holders in order to carry out the terms and provision of this  Section 11, including, without limitation, executing and delivering instruments of transfer  (the shares the subject of which to be free and clear of impermissible liens, claims and  encumbrances), instruments of conveyance and transfer, and any purchase agreement,  merger agreement, any associated indemnity agreement, or escrow agreement, any  associated voting, support, or joinder agreement, consent, waiver, governmental filing,  and any similar or related documents;  
(iv) not to deposit or transfer, and to cause their Affiliates not to deposit  
or transfer, except as provided in this Section 11, any Shares of the Company owned by  such party or Affiliate in a voting trust or subject any Shares to any arrangement or  agreement with respect to the voting of such Shares, unless specifically requested to do so  by the acquirer in connection with the Change in Control;  
(v) to refrain from (i) exercising any dissenters’ rights or rights of  
appraisal under applicable law at any time with respect to such Change in Control, or (ii);  asserting any claim or commencing any suit (x) challenging the Change in Control or this  Plan, or (y) alleging a breach of any fiduciary duty of the Electing Holders or any affiliate  
-19-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
or associate thereof (including, without limitation, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary  duty) in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or entry into the Change in Control, or  the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby; 
(vi) if the consideration to be paid in exchange for the Shares pursuant  
to this Section 11 includes any securities and due receipt thereof by any Participant would  require under applicable law (x) the registration or qualification of such securities or of any  person as a broker or dealer or agent with respect to such securities; or (y) the provision to  any Participant of any information other than such information as a prudent issuer would  generally furnish in an offering made solely to “accredited investors” as defined in  Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, the Company may cause to be paid to  any such Participant in lieu thereof, against surrender of the Shares which would have  otherwise been sold by such Participant, an amount in cash equal to the fair value (as  determined in good faith by the Board) of the securities which such Participant would  otherwise receive as of the date of the issuance of such securities in exchange for the  Shares; and  
(vii) in the event that the Electing Holders, in connection with such 
Change in Control, appoint a shareholder representative (the “Stockholder  Representative”) with respect to matters affecting the Participant under the applicable  definitive transaction agreements following consummation of such Change in Control, (x)  to consent to (i) the appointment of such Stockholder Representative, (ii) the establishment  of any applicable escrow, expense or similar fund in connection with any indemnification  or similar obligations, and (iii) the payment of such Participant’s pro rata portion (from the  applicable escrow or expense fund or otherwise) of any and all reasonable fees and  expenses to such Stockholder Representative in connection with such Stockholder  Representative’s services and duties in connection with such Change in Control and its  related service as the representative of the Participant, and (y) not to assert any claim or  commence any suit against the Stockholder Representative or any other Person with respect  to any action or inaction taken or failed to be taken by the Stockholder Representative,  within the scope of the Stockholder Representative’s authority, in connection with its  service as the Stockholder Representative, absent fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct.  
(b) Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a  Participant will not be required to comply with Section 11(a) above in connection with any  proposed Change in Control (the “Proposed Sale”), unless:  
(i) any representations and warranties to be made by such Participant  
in connection with the Proposed Sale are limited to representations and warranties related  to authority, ownership and in the case of Shares, the ability to convey title to such Shares,  including, but not limited to, representations and warranties that (A) the Participant holds  all right, title and interest in and to the Options or Shares such Participant purports to hold,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (B) the obligations of the Participant in  connection with the transaction have been duly authorized, if applicable, (C) the documents  to be entered into by the Participant have been duly executed by the Participant and  
-20-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
delivered to the acquirer and are enforceable (subject to customary limitations) against the  Participant in accordance with their respective terms; and (D) neither the execution and  delivery of documents to be entered into by the Participant in connection with the  transaction, nor the performance of the Participant’s obligations thereunder, will cause a  breach or violation of the terms of any agreement to which the Participant is a party, or any  law or judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental agency that applies to the  Participant;  
(ii) the Participant is not liable for the breach of any representation,  
warranty or covenant made by any other Person in connection with the Proposed Sale, other  than the Company (except to the extent that funds may be paid out of an escrow established  to cover breach of representations, warranties and covenants of the Company as well as  breach by any Company equity holder of any of identical representations, warranties and  covenants provided by all equity holders);  
(iii) liability shall be limited to such Participant's applicable share (based  
on the respective gross or net proceeds payable to each equity holder in connection with  such Proposed Sale as determined by the Board and in accordance with the Company’s  certificate of incorporation in effect prior to the consummation of such Change in Control)  of a negotiated aggregate indemnification amount that applies equally to all equity holders  but that in no event exceeds the amount of consideration otherwise payable to such  Participant in connection with such Proposed Sale, except with respect to claims related to  fraud by such Participant, the liability for which need not be limited as to such Participant;  
(iv) upon the consummation of the Proposed Sale (A) each holder of  
each class or series of the Company will receive the same form of consideration for their  shares of such class or series as is received by other holders in respect of their shares of  such same class or series of shares, (B) each holder of Ordinary Shares will receive the  same amount of consideration per share of Ordinary Shares as is received by other holders  in respect of their Ordinary Shares and (C) unless waived pursuant to the terms of the  Company’s certificate of incorporation then in effect, and as may be required by law, the  aggregate consideration receivable by all holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock  shall be allocated among the holders of such shares on the basis of the relative liquidation  preferences to which such holders are entitled in a Change in Control (assuming for this  purpose that the Proposed Sale is a Change in Control) in accordance with the Company’s  certificate of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the Proposed Sale; provided,  however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11(b)(iv), if the  consideration to be paid in exchange for the Participant’s Shares pursuant to this Section  11(b)(iv) includes any securities and due receipt thereof by any Participant would require  under applicable law (A) the registration or qualification of such securities or of any person  as a broker or dealer or agent with respect to such securities; or (B) the provision to any  Participant of any information other than such information as a prudent issuer would  generally furnish in an offering made solely to “accredited investors” as defined in  Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, the Company may cause to be paid to  any such Participant in lieu thereof, against surrender of the Participant’s Shares which  
-21-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
would have otherwise been sold by such Participant, an amount in cash equal to the fair  value (as determined in good faith by the Board) of the securities which such Participant  would otherwise receive as of the date of the issuance of such securities in exchange for  the Participant’s Shares;  
(c) Irrevocable Proxy and Power of Attorney.  
(i) Proxy and Power of Attorney. Participant hereby constitutes and  
appoints as proxy and hereby grants a power of attorney to the Board of Directors, and a  designee of the Electing Holders, and each of them, with full power of substitution, with  respect to votes regarding any Change in Control pursuant to Section 11 hereof, and hereby  authorizes each of them to represent and vote, if and only if the party (i) fails to vote, or  (ii) attempts to vote (whether by proxy, in person or by written consent), in a manner which  is inconsistent with the terms of Section 11 of this Plan, all of such party’s Shares in  approval of any Change in Control pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and  provisions of Section 11 or to take any action reasonably necessary to effect Section 11 of  this Plan. The power of attorney granted hereunder shall authorize the President of the  Company to execute and deliver the documentation referred to in Section 11(a)(iii) on  behalf of any party failing to do so within five (5) calendar days of a request by the  Company. Each of the proxy and power of attorney granted pursuant to this Section 11(c)  is given in consideration of the right to receive an Award, and as such, each is coupled with  an interest and shall be irrevocable unless and until such obligations expire in accordance  with Section 11(e). Subject to Section 11(e), Participant hereby revokes any and all  previous proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the Shares and shall not hereafter,  unless and until this Section 11 shall cease to apply in accordance with Section 11(e),  purport to grant any other proxy or power of attorney with respect to any of the Shares,  deposit any of the Shares into a voting trust or enter into any other agreement, arrangement  or understanding with any person, directly or indirectly, to vote, grant any proxy or give  instructions with respect to the voting of any of the Shares, in each case, with respect to  any of the matters set forth herein.  
(ii) Specific Enforcement. Any breach of this Section 11 would result in  
substantial harm to the Company and its shareholders for which monetary damages alone  could not adequately compensate; therefore, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction  to prevent breaches of this Section 11, and to specific enforcement of this Section 11 and  its terms and provisions in any action instituted in any court of the United States or any  state having subject matter jurisdiction.  
(iii) Remedies Cumulative. All remedies, either under this Plan or by law  
or otherwise afforded to the Company, shall be cumulative and not alternative.  
(d) Transfers. Each permitted transferee or assignee of any Options or Shares  issued pursuant to the Plan shall continue to be subject to Section 11 hereof, and such transferee  shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver an acknowledgement in form provided by the  Company as confirmation that such permitted transferee or assignee shall be bound by all the terms  
-22-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
and conditions of this Section 11. No Participant shall transfer or assign any Options or Shares to  any Person who has not complied with the foregoing obligation.  
(e) Conflicting Agreements. In the event of a conflict between this Section 11  and any other agreement between a Participant and the Company (whether existing today or first  executed after the date hereof), that contains a drag-along in connection with a Change in Control  and/or proxy and power of attorney related thereto, the Company and the Participant acknowledge  and agree that the terms of such other agreement shall control and compliance with such other  agreement shall be deemed compliance with this Section 11 in full.  
SECTION 12. Market Stand-Off  
(a) Agreement to Lock-Up. Each Participant hereby agrees that it will not,  without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter, during the period commencing on  the date of the final prospectus relating to the Company’s initial Public Offering (the “IPO”) and  ending on the date specified by the Company and the managing underwriter (such period not to  exceed one hundred eighty (180) days), or such other period as may be requested by the Company  or an underwriter to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (1) the publication or other  distribution of research reports; and (2) analyst recommendations and opinions, including, but not  limited to, the restrictions contained in applicable FINRA rules, or any successor provisions or  amendments thereto), (a) lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to  purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or  otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Company capital stock held  immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement for the IPO; or (b) enter into  any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic  consequences of ownership of Company shares, whether any such transaction described in clause  (a) or (b) above is to be settled by issue of shares of the Company or other securities, in cash or  otherwise. The foregoing provisions of this Section 12 shall not apply to the sale of any shares to  an underwriter pursuant to an underwriting agreement. The underwriters in connection with the  IPO are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 12 and shall have the right, power and  authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Each Participant  further agrees to execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters in  the IPO that are consistent with this Section 12 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto.  
(b) Stop Transfer Instructions. In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, the  Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of the Company of each  Participant (and transferees and assignees thereof) until the end of such restricted period. 
SECTION 13. Right of First Refusal  
(a) Right of First Refusal.  
(i) Grant. Subject to the terms of Section 13(c) below, each Participant  
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Company (and any assignee of the  Company) a Right of First Refusal to purchase all or any portion of Transfer Stock that  
-23-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
such Participant may propose to transfer in a Proposed Transfer, at the same price and on  the same terms and conditions as those offered to the Prospective Transferee. The  Company may assign its Right of First Refusal in whole or in part to one or more persons  with respect to any Proposed Transfer and without the consent of the Participant.  
(ii) Notice. Each Participant proposing to make a Proposed Transfer 
must deliver a Proposed Transfer Notice to the Company not later than sixty (60) days prior  to the consummation of such Proposed Transfer. Such Proposed Transfer Notice shall  contain the material terms and conditions (including price and form of consideration) of  the Proposed Transfer, the identity of the Prospective Transferee and the intended date of  the Proposed Transfer. To exercise its Right of First Refusal under this Section 13(a), the  Company and/or ROFR Assignee(s), as applicable, must deliver a ROFR Exercise Notice  to the selling Participant within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Proposed Transfer  Notice specifying the number of shares of Transfer Stock to be purchased by the Company  and/or ROFR Assignee(s), as applicable. In the event of a conflict between this Section 13  and any other agreement between a Participant and the Company (whether existing today  or first executed after the date hereof) that contains a right of first refusal, the Company  and the Participant acknowledge and agree that the terms of such other agreement shall  control and compliance with such other agreement shall be deemed compliance with this  Section 13 in full.  
(iii) Consideration; Closing. If the consideration proposed to be paid for  
the Transfer Stock is in property, services or other non-cash consideration, the fair market  value of the consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board and as set forth  in the ROFR Exercise Notice. If the Company or any ROFR Assignee cannot for any  reason pay for the Transfer Stock in the same form of non-cash consideration, the Company  and/or such ROFR Assignee, as applicable, may pay the cash value equivalent thereof, as  determined in good faith by the Board and as set forth in the ROFR Exercise Notice. The  closing of the purchase of Transfer Stock by the Company and/or any ROFR Assignee(s)  shall take place, and all payments from the Company and/or ROFR Assignee(s) shall have  been delivered to the selling Participant, by the later of (i) the date specified in the Proposed  Transfer Notice as the intended date of the Proposed Transfer; and (ii) sixty (60) days after  delivery of the Proposed Transfer Notice. Other than with respect to Exempt Transfers  under Section 13(c), the Board may require a Participant to make a payment of up to $2,000  to the Company to cover administrative costs and expenses associated with any Proposed  Transfer.  
(iv) Additional Compliance. The number of Transfer Stock a Participant  
may transfer in connection with a Proposed Transfer shall be reduced by the number of  Transfer Stock acquired by the Company and/or ROFR Assignee(s) pursuant to this  Section 13. If a Proposed Transfer is not consummated by the date specified in the  Proposed Transfer Notice as the intended date of the Proposed Transfer, the Participant  proposing the Proposed Transfer may not sell any Transfer Stock unless they first comply  in full (again) with each provision of this Section 13. The exercise or election not to  
-24-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
exercise any right by the Company hereunder shall not adversely affect its right to  participate in any other sales of Transfer Stock subject to this Section 13.  
(v) Transfers. Any successor or permitted assignee of a Participant,  
including any ROFR Assignee and any Prospective Transferee who acquires shares of  Transfer Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall become subject to Section 13  hereof, and such successor or permitted assignee shall, as a condition to such transfer,  confirm their agreement (in form provided by the Company) to be subject to and bound by  all of the provisions set forth in this Section 13 that were applicable to the predecessor or  assignor of such successor or permitted assignee. No Participant shall transfer or assign  any Shares to any Person who has not complied with the foregoing obligation.  
(b) Effect of Failure to Comply.  
(i) Transfer Void; Equitable Relief. Any Proposed Transfer not made  
in compliance with the requirements of this Section 13 shall be null and void ab initio, shall  not be recorded on the books of the Company (including its Register of Members) or its  transfer agent and shall not be recognized by the Company. Any breach of this Section 13  would result in substantial harm to the Company and its shareholders for which monetary  damages alone could not adequately compensate; therefore, the Company and any ROFR  Assignee shall be entitled to seek protective orders, injunctive relief and other remedies  available at law or in equity (including, without limitation, seeking specific performance  or the rescission of purchases, sales and other transfers of Transfer Stock not made in strict  compliance with this Plan).  
(ii) Violation of First Refusal Right. If any Participant becomes  
obligated to sell any Transfer Stock to the Company and/or any ROFR Assignee(s) under  this Section 13 and fails to transfer such Transfer Stock in accordance with the terms of  this Section 13, the Company and/or ROFR Assignee(s) may, at its option, in addition to  all other remedies it may have, send to such Participant the purchase price for such Transfer  Stock as is herein specified and transfer to the name of the Company or such ROFR  Assignee (or in the case of a ROFR Assignee, request that the Company effect such transfer  in the name of such ROFR Assignee) on the Company’s books any certificates,  instruments, or book entry representing the Transfer Stock to be sold. Without limitation  to the generality of the appointment of attorneys pursuant to Section 11(c), for these  purposes, any documents required in respect of the transfer of the Transfer Stock may  signed or executed on behalf of the Participant pursuant thereto including, without  limitation, any instrument of transfer.  
(c) Exempt Transfers.  
(i) Exempted Transfers. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything  
contrary herein, other than Section 13(c)(i), the provisions of Sections 13(a) and 13(b) shall  not apply (x) in the case of a Participant that is an entity, upon a transfer by such Participant  to its shareholders, members, partners or other equity holders, (y) to a pledge of Transfer  
-25-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
Stock that creates a mere security interest in the pledged Transfer Stock, provided that the  pledgee thereof agrees in writing in advance to be bound by and comply with all applicable  provisions of this Plan to the same extent as if it were the Participant making such pledge  or (z) in the case of a Participant that is a natural person, upon a transfer of Transfer Stock  by such Participant made for bona fide estate planning purposes, either during his or her  lifetime or on death by will or intestacy to his or her spouse, child (natural or adopted), or  any other direct lineal descendant of such Participant (or his or her spouse) (all of the  foregoing collectively referred to as “family members”), or any other person approved by  the Board (in its sole and absolute discretion), or any custodian or trustee of any trust,  partnership or limited liability company for the benefit of, or the ownership interests of  which are owned wholly by such Participant or any such family members; provided that in  the case of clause(s) (x), (y) or (z), the Participant shall deliver prior written notice to the  Company of such pledge, gift or transfer and such shares of Transfer Stock shall at all times  remain subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in this Plan and such transferee shall,  as a condition to such transfer, deliver an acknowledgement in form provided by the  Company as confirmation that such transferee shall be bound by all the terms and  conditions of this Section 13 as a Participant (but only with respect to the securities so  transferred to the transferee), including the obligations of a Participant with respect to  Proposed Transfers of such Transfer Stock; and provided further in the case of any transfer  pursuant to clause (x) or (z) above, that absent consent of the Board (which consent may  be given or withheld in the Board’s sole and absolute discretion for any reason or no  reason), such transfer is made pursuant to a transaction in which there is no consideration  actually paid for such transfer.  
(ii) Exempted Offerings. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to  
the contrary herein other than Section 13(c)(iii), the provisions of Section 13 shall not apply  to the sale of any Transfer Stock (a) to the public in a Public Offering or (b) pursuant to a  Change in Control.  
(iii) Prohibited Transferees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no  
Participant shall transfer any Transfer Stock to (a) any entity which, in the determination  of the Board, directly or indirectly competes with the Company; or (b) any customer,  distributor or supplier of the Company, if the Board should determine that such transfer  would result in such customer, distributor or supplier receiving information that would  place the Company at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such customer, distributor  or supplier.  
SECTION 14. Unfunded Status of Plan. The Plan is intended to be  “unfunded.” With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing  contained herein will give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general  creditor of the Company. In its sole and absolute discretion, the Board may authorize the creation  of grantor trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver  Shares or payments in lieu of Shares or with respect to Awards. 
-26-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
SECTION 15. Substitute Options. Awards may, in the sole discretion of  the Board, be granted under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards  previously granted by an entity acquired by the Company or an Affiliate or with which the  Company or an Affiliate combines (“Substitute Awards”). Substitute Awards shall not be counted  against the number of Shares available for issuance under Section 3 of the Plan; provided, that,  Substitute Awards issued in connection with the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding  Options that are intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options shall be counted against the number  of Shares set forth in Section 3(b) that may granted as Incentive Stock Options.  
SECTION 16. General Provisions.  
(a) The Board shall condition any Award upon compliance with applicable  securities laws. No Awards shall be granted under the Plan and no Shares shall be issued and  delivered upon the exercise of Options granted under the Plan unless and until the Company and/or  the Participant have complied with all applicable federal and state registration, listing and/or  qualification requirements and all other requirements of law or of any regulatory agencies having  jurisdiction. The Board may require each Participant to represent to and agree with the Company  in writing that the Participant is acquiring securities of the Company for investment purposes and  without a view to distribution thereof and as to such other matters as the Board believes are  appropriate. The certificate evidencing any Award and any securities issued pursuant thereto may  include any legend which the Board deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer and  compliance with applicable securities laws. All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered  under the Plan will be subject to such share-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Board may  deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities Act, the  Exchange Act, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any other applicable  federal or state securities laws, and the Board may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such  certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.  
(b) Proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Shares pursuant to  Awards, or upon exercise thereof, shall constitute general assets of the Company.  
(c) Except as provided in the Plan, or an Award Agreement, no Participant shall  be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any Shares  subject to an Award unless and until such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise or  settlement of the Award pursuant to its terms (including, without limitation, any obligation to  execute a Stockholders Agreement) and, except pursuant to Section 3(c) hereof, no adjustment  shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other  property) or distributions of other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the Participant  becomes the record owner of such Shares.  
(d) Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other  or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is  required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific  cases.

(e) Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the execution of any document in  connection with the Plan shall (i) confer upon any person any right to continued employment or  engagement with the Company or any of its Affiliates, or (ii) interfere in any way with the right of  the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment or engagement of any of its employees  or other service providers at any time.  
(f) No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the  gross income of the Participant for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Award under  the Plan, the Participant shall be obligated to pay to the Company, or make arrangements  satisfactory to the Board regarding the payment of any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any  kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. In the sole and absolute  discretion of the Board, the minimum required withholding obligations may be settled with Shares,  including Shares that are part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement. The  obligations of the Company under the Plan will be conditioned on such payment or arrangements  and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes  from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant.  
(g) Any Shares issued under the Plan shall be recorded in the Register of  Members when issued. Upon a Participant’s request, Ordinary Shares certificates in an appropriate  amount will be delivered to the Participant (except to the extent that the Company or another  Person is permitted to hold such share certificates).  
SECTION 17. Effective Date of Plan. The Plan will become effective on the  date that it is adopted by the Board. In the event the Plan is not approved by the Company’s  shareholders within twelve (12) months of the Plan’s adoption by the Board, any Incentive Stock  Option granted prior to the expiration of such 12-month period shall be treated for all purposes as  a Non-Qualified Stock Option.  
SECTION 18. Term of Plan. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 10;  no Award may be granted hereunder on or after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), but any  Award granted prior to the termination of the Plan or the Expiration Date shall continue in effect  thereafter in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Plan. The “Expiration  Date” is the 10-year anniversary of the earlier of the date of the Plan’s adoption by the Board and  the date of shareholder approval of the Plan; provided, however, if the Board and if the  shareholders approve an amendment that increases the number of shares subject to the Plan after  its initial adoption, the Expiration Date shall be the 10th anniversary of the date of the earlier of  Board or shareholder approval of such increase.  
SECTION 19. Invalid Provisions. In the event that any provision of this Plan  is found to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable under any applicable law, such invalidity or  unenforceability will not be construed as rendering any other provisions contained herein as invalid  or unenforceable, and all such other provisions will be given full force and effect to the same extent  as though the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained herein.

SECTION 20. Governing Law. The Plan and all Awards granted hereunder  will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws and judicial decisions of the state  of Delaware, without regard to the application of the principles of conflicts of laws of the state of  Delaware or any other jurisdiction.  
SECTION 21. Plan Headings. The headings in the Plan are for purposes of  convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the construction of the provisions hereof.  
SECTION 22. Board Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set  forth in the Plan, any and all actions of the Board or Committee, as the case may be, taken under  or in connection with the Plan and any agreements, instruments, documents, certificates or other  writings entered into, executed, granted, issued and/or delivered pursuant to the terms hereof, will  be subject to and limited by any and all votes, consents, approvals, waivers or other actions of all  or certain shareholders of the Company or other persons required by:  
(a) the Memorandum and Articles; and  
(b) any other agreement, instrument, document or writing now or hereafter  existing, between or among the Company and its shareholders or other persons (as the same may  be amended from time to time).  
SECTION 23. Notices. Any notice to be given to the Company pursuant to the  provisions of the Plan must be delivered by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, and,  addressed, if to the Company to the Board of Directors (or such other person as the Company may  designate in writing from time to time) at its principal executive office, and, if to a Participant, to  the address given beneath his or her signature on his or her Award Agreement, or at such other  address as such Participant may hereafter designate in writing to the Company. Any such notice  will be deemed duly given on the date and at the time delivered via personal, courier or recognized  overnight delivery service or, if sent via telecopier, on the date and at the time telecopied with  confirmation of delivery or, if mailed, on the date five (5) days after the date of the mailing (which  will be by regular, registered or certified mail). Delivery of a notice by telecopy (with  confirmation) will be permitted and will be considered delivery of a notice notwithstanding that it  is not an original that is received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may give notice  to any Participant by (a) electronic transmission, which shall be deemed effective if given by a  form of electronic transmission consented to by such Person or that the Company reasonably  believes will be received by such Person and/or (b) any other method that the Company is  permitted under the Memorandum and Articles to use when giving a notice to a shareholder of the  Company.  
SECTION 24. Section 280G.  
(a) If any payment, benefit or distribution of any type to a Participant or for  Participant’s benefit, whether paid or payable, provided or to be provided, or distributed or  distributable pursuant to the terms of the Plan or an Award Agreement or otherwise (collectively,  the “Parachute Payments”) could subject a Participant to the excise tax imposed under Section  
-29-  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331
4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”) or may not be deductible as a result of Section 280G of the  Code, the Parachute Payments shall be reduced so that the maximum amount of the Parachute  Payments (after reduction) shall be one dollar ($1.00) less than the amount which would cause the  Parachute Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax or would cause the Parachute Payments to not  be deductible.  
(b) Notwithstanding Section 24(a), the limitation of Section 24(a) above shall  not apply to limit the Parachute Payments if, in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the  Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1, persons who, immediately prior to the  applicable change in ownership of a corporation, change in the effective control of a corporation,  or change in the ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation’s assets (each as defined in  Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1), own equity of the Company possessing more than  seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all outstanding equity of the Company held by  equityholders eligible to vote, vote to approve any such payments or benefits, or portion thereof,  which could be subject to the Excise Tax or may be subject to disallowance of deductions under  Section 280G of the Code absent such shareholder approval.  
SECTION 25. Section 409A. This Plan and all Award Agreements shall be  interpreted in a manner that complies with or is exempt from Section 409A of the Code (“Section  409A”). Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any Award or  benefit provided under this Plan is subject to the provisions of Section 409A, the provisions of the  Plan and any applicable Award shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner  necessary to comply with Section 409A or an exception thereto (or disregarded to the extent such  provision cannot be so administered, interpreted or construed). Notwithstanding anything in the  Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, in the event that any provision of the Plan or an  Award Agreement is determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, to not comply with the  requirements of Section 409A or an exemption thereto, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion,  have the authority to take such actions and to make such interpretations or changes to the Plan or  an Award Agreement as the Board deems necessary, regardless of whether such actions,  interpretations, or changes shall adversely affect a Participant, subject to the limitations, if any, of  applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing:  
(a) For purposes of Section 409A, and to the extent applicable to any Award or  benefit under the Plan, it is intended that distribution events qualify as permissible distribution  events for purposes of Section 409A and shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. With  respect to payments subject to Section 409A, the Company reserves the right to accelerate and/or  defer any payment to the extent permitted and consistent with Section 409A. Whether a Participant  has “separated from service” (within the meaning of Section 409A) will be determined based on  all of the facts and circumstances and, to the extent applicable to any Award or benefit, in  accordance with the guidance issued under Section 409A.  
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement,  if at the time of a Participant’s termination of employment, such Participant is a “specified  employee”, determined in accordance with Section 409A, any payment or benefit provided under  this Plan that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A that is  
-30-

provided to such Participant on account of such Participant’s separation from service shall not be  paid until the first payroll date to occur following the six (6)-month anniversary of the Participant’s  termination date (the “Specified Employee Payment Date”). The aggregate amount of any  payments or benefits that would otherwise have been made during such six (6)-month period shall  be paid in a lump sum on the Specified Employee Payment Date, without interest, and thereafter,  any remaining payments or benefits shall be paid without delay in accordance with their original  schedule. If such Participant dies during the six (6)-month period, any delayed payments shall be  paid to such Participant’s estate in a lump sum as soon as practicable, and in all events within thirty  (30) days, after the date of such Participant’s death. 
(c) The grant of Non-Qualified Stock Options and other stock rights or share rights may be granted under terms and conditions consistent with Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(5) such that any such Award does not constitute a deferral of compensation under Section 409A. 
(d) In no event shall any member of the Board, the Committee or the Company or any of its Affiliates (or any employee, officer, director or Consultant of the Company or any of  its Affiliates) have any liability to any Participant (or any other Person) due to the failure of the  Plan or an Award to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A.

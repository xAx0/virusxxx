What is the basic structure of the Plan? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c263"><span class="c1">Under the Plan, the Company may grant eligible individuals options that will provide such &nbsp;individuals with the right to purchase Ordinary Shares at a fixed price per share over a specified &nbsp;period of time. All options granted under the Plan will vest over a specified period of time. The &nbsp;Plan also allows for the grant of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">RSUs</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;), and other &nbsp;share-based awards that, may result in the recipient owning Ordinary Shares that are the subject of &nbsp;vesting restrictions associated with such awards provided for under the Plan until such vesting &nbsp;restrictions lapse. Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, and Other Share-Based &nbsp;Awards that may be made under the Plan are collectively referred to as &ldquo;Awards&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c2">2. When was the Plan adopted? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c236"><span class="c1">The Plan was adopted by the Board on January __, 2022. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c254"><span class="c2">3. Who administers the Plan? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c175"><span class="c1">-1- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c206"><span class="c1">The Plan will be administered by the Board or a committee appointed by the Board &nbsp;composed of at least one member. The Board or committee of the Board that administers the Plan &nbsp;will be referred to in this document as the &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Administrator</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c337"><span class="c1">The Administrator will have full authority and complete discretion to interpret the Plan and &nbsp;to determine the persons who are to be granted Awards, the time or times when such Awards are &nbsp;to be granted, the number of shares to be subject to each such Award, the time or times at which &nbsp;such Awards may be exercised, the vesting schedule applicable to such Awards and the maximum &nbsp;periods for which such Awards are to remain outstanding. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c2">4. Who is eligible to participate in the Plan? </span></p><p class="c131"><span class="c1">Employees, leased employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company are &nbsp;eligible to participate in the Plan. However, the actual persons to whom Awards are to be made &nbsp;under such program will be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">5. How many Ordinary Shares may be issued under the Plan? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c100"><span class="c1">The maximum number of Ordinary Shares issuable over the term of the Plan may not &nbsp;exceed 5,330,685 shares (subject to adjustment by the Board and the Company&rsquo;s shareholder). &nbsp;The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be subject to further adjustment &nbsp;in the event of a Recapitalization (as described below) and can be increased with requisite approval &nbsp;from the Board and Company&rsquo;s shareholders. Should one or more outstanding options granted &nbsp;under the Plan expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise in full, or should restricted &nbsp;shares, RSUs, or other share-based awards be canceled, forfeited, or repurchased for any reason, &nbsp;the Ordinary Shares subject to the portion of such options not so exercised or the portion of such &nbsp;restricted shares, RSUs, or other share-based awards canceled, forfeited, or repurchased (as the &nbsp;case may be) will be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan. In addition, if any share is &nbsp;withheld in settlement of a tax withholding obligation associated with an award, or any share is &nbsp;received by, or surrendered to, the Company in satisfaction of the exercise price payable upon &nbsp;exercise of an option, that share will become available for grant under the Plan. The Ordinary &nbsp;Shares will be made available either from authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares or from &nbsp;Ordinary Shares reacquired by the Company. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">6. What happens if there is a change in the Company&rsquo;s capital structure? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c345 c433"><span class="c1">In the event of a Recapitalization, subject to any required action by the shareholders of the &nbsp;Company, appropriate adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of &nbsp;securities issuable under the Plan (on both an aggregate and per participant basis) and (ii) the &nbsp;number and/or class of securities and the exercise price per share in effect under each outstanding &nbsp;option and other Awards. For purposes of this Plan Summary, a &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Recapitalization</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; is generally &nbsp;any type of stock dividend (which includes any issue of bonus shares), stock split, division of &nbsp;shares, combination or reclassification of shares, merger, consolidation or other similar type of &nbsp;change in capitalization. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">7. Can the Plan be amended or terminated? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c180"><span class="c1">-2- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c286"><span class="c1">Yes. The Board has exclusive authority to amend or modify the Plan in any and all &nbsp;respects. However, no amendment or modification may, without the consent of the holder of an &nbsp;Award, materially impair such holder&rsquo;s rights or obligations under his or her outstanding Awards &nbsp;under the Plan. In addition, certain amendments to the Plan may require approval of the &nbsp;Company&rsquo;s shareholders. The Board may terminate the Plan at any time, although no such &nbsp;termination will materially impair Awards granted prior to such action without consent. The Plan &nbsp;will terminate when the Board determines to discontinue the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, &nbsp;Awards may be amended, modified, or terminated, without consent, to conform with the &nbsp;requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Code</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;). &nbsp;In addition, consent will not be required for any modification or amendment of an Incentive Stock &nbsp;Option that causes that Incentive Stock Option (i) to become a Non-Qualified Stock Option or (ii) &nbsp;to be considered granted as of the date of such modification or amendment pursuant to Section 424 &nbsp;of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.424-1(e). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c351"><span class="c12">GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">8. How are options granted under the Plan? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c266"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The Administrator will have complete discretion to determine when and to whom options &nbsp;will be granted and all the terms of each such option. Each option grant will be evidenced by one &nbsp;or more documents (collectively, the &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Option Agreement</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) executed by the Company and the &nbsp;optionee. The Option Agreement will require the optionee to make certain representations and &nbsp;promises prior to and in connection with the issuance of any shares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2">9. What type of options may be granted under the Plan? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c197"><span class="c1">Incentive stock options (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Incentive Stock Options</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) designed to meet the requirements of &nbsp;Section 422 of the Code, or options that do not satisfy such requirements (&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Non-Qualified Stock &nbsp;Options</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) may be granted under the Plan. For a discussion of the difference in tax treatment under &nbsp;the Code between Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Stock Options , see the &ldquo;Questions &nbsp;and Answers on Federal Tax Consequences&rdquo; section below. Please consult your Option &nbsp;Agreement to determine whether your options are intended to be Incentive Stock Options or Non </span></p><p class="c63"><span class="c1">Qualified Stock Options. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c267"><span class="c2">10. How is the exercise price determined? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c41"><span class="c1">The exercise price of an option will be determined by the Administrator. However (i) no &nbsp;option granted under the Plan will have an exercise price less than one hundred percent (100%) of &nbsp;the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares on the date of grant and (ii) no Incentive Stock Option &nbsp;granted to a &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">10% Stockholder</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (defined as any shareholder owning more than 10% of the voting &nbsp;power of all classes of shares of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company) will have an &nbsp;exercise price less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Ordinary &nbsp;Shares on the grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options may be granted with an exercise &nbsp;price lower than fair market value on the date of the grant if (i) the options are granted in &nbsp;assumption or substitution of outstanding awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the &nbsp;Company or an affiliate or with which the Company or an affiliate combines, or (ii) the options &nbsp;are otherwise exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c48"><span class="c1">-3- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c2">11. How is the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares determined? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c276"><span class="c1">Until such time as the Company&rsquo;s shares are traded on a national market, the fair market &nbsp;value of the Ordinary Shares will be determined by the Administrator. </span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c2">12. Can I assign or transfer my option? </span></p><p class="c243"><span class="c1">Unless approved by the Administrator in writing, an option may not be transferred in any &nbsp;manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution (and subject always to the &nbsp;requirements of British Virgin Islands law) and may be exercised, during the lifetime of an &nbsp;optionee, only by the optionee. If the Administrator makes an option transferable, the &nbsp;Administrator has the authority to make such changes in the applicable options as the &nbsp;Administrator determines to be appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the approval &nbsp;of the Administrator, Non-Qualified Stock Options may be assigned in whole or in part during &nbsp;your lifetime to one or more members of your immediate family or to a trust established &nbsp;exclusively for you and/or one or more of your immediate family members or to your former &nbsp;spouse, to the extent such assignment is in connection with your estate plan or pursuant to a &nbsp;domestic relations order. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c2">13. When do I acquire the rights of a shareholder? </span></p><p class="c262"><span class="c1">You will not have any shareholder rights with respect to shares subject to stock options. &nbsp;You will not acquire shareholder rights until you exercise the option, pay the exercise price, the &nbsp;shares are issued and you become a holder of record in the register of members of the Company &nbsp;of the purchased shares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c12">EXERCISE OF OPTIONS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c123"><span class="c2">14. When may I exercise my option? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c287"><span class="c1">Your option will become exercisable in a series of installments over the period that you &nbsp;remain in the Company&rsquo;s service. You may exercise your option at any time for the shares for &nbsp;which your option is exercisable, provided that you do so before the option terminates. The &nbsp;exercise schedule applicable to your option will be determined by the Administrator at the time of &nbsp;grant and will be set forth in the Option Agreement. To the extent provided in your Option &nbsp;Agreement, you may be able to exercise your options before they have become exercisable under &nbsp;the exercise schedule (an &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Early Exercise</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;). Shares purchased as a result of an Early Exercise &nbsp;will be restricted shares (see questions 24 through 28). Your Option Agreement will indicate &nbsp;whether you have a right to purchase shares through an Early Exercise. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c2">15. When will my option terminate? </span></p><p class="c282"><span class="c1">No option granted under the Plan may have a term in excess of 120 months. The actual &nbsp;expiration date of your option will be set forth in the Option Agreement. Your option will, &nbsp;however, terminate prior to its designated expiration date in the event of your termination of &nbsp;service or upon the occurrence of certain other events. See the &ldquo;Early Termination of Options&rdquo; &nbsp;section below and see your Option Agreement. An Incentive Stock Option granted to a 10% &nbsp;Stockholder must expire no more than five years after the date of grant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c447"><span class="c1">-4- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c2">16. How do I exercise my option? </span></p><p class="c55"><span class="c1">To exercise your option, you must provide the Company with written notice of the exercise &nbsp;stating the number of shares to be purchased under your option. The notice must be accompanied &nbsp;by payment of the exercise price for the purchased shares, together with appropriate proof that the &nbsp;person exercising the option (if other than yourself) has the right to effect such exercise. You will &nbsp;be required to satisfy all applicable income and employment tax withholding requirements at that &nbsp;time. For information about such tax withholding, see the &ldquo;Questions and Answers on Federal &nbsp;Tax Consequences&rdquo; section below. Also, the Company may require you to enter into one or more &nbsp;agreements pertaining to your rights as a shareholder as a pre-condition to the exercise of your &nbsp;option. See the applicable Plan and Option Agreement provisions. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c2">17. How do I pay the exercise price? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c448"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">The exercise price may be paid in cash or check payable to the Company. The Plan also &nbsp;provides that the exercise price can be paid via other methods approved by the Administrator in &nbsp;its sole discretion. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c352"><span class="c12">INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c382"><span class="c1">This section applies only to Incentive Stock Options. Non-Qualified Stock Options are not &nbsp;subject to these provisions. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c2">18. Who is eligible to receive an Incentive Stock Option? </span></p><p class="c384"><span class="c1">Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to individuals who are employees of the &nbsp;Company. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c208"><span class="c2">19. Is there a limitation on the number of shares for which an Incentive Stock Option may &nbsp;become exercisable in any one calendar year? </span></p><p class="c155"><span class="c1">Yes. The aggregate fair market value of the Ordinary Shares (determined at the date of &nbsp;grant) for which an option may for the first time become exercisable in any calendar year as an &nbsp;Incentive Stock Option may not exceed $100,000. To the extent you hold two or more Incentive &nbsp;Stock Options that become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, the $100,000 &nbsp;limitation will be applied on the basis of the order in which those options were granted. Options &nbsp;that do not qualify for Incentive Stock Option treatment under the Federal tax laws by reason of &nbsp;this dollar limitation may nevertheless be exercised as Non-Qualified Stock Options in the calendar &nbsp;year in which they become exercisable for the excess number of shares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c2">20. Can an Incentive Stock Option lose its qualified status? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c240"><span class="c1">Yes. An option granted as an Incentive Stock Option will generally be taxed as a Non Qualified Stock Option if exercised more than three months after your termination of employment &nbsp;with the Company or if you do not hold the Ordinary Shares for a required holding period (two &nbsp;years from date of grant and one year from date of exercise). Certain amendments or modifications &nbsp;to an outstanding option may also cause the loss of Incentive Stock Option status. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c210"><span class="c1">-5- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c138"><span class="c12">EARLY TERMINATION OF OPTIONS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c185"><span class="c2">21. What happens to my options if my service terminates? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c330"><span class="c1">After your termination of service, you will have a limited period of time in which to &nbsp;exercise your </span><span class="c0">vested</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;outstanding options. The length of this period may depend on the reason for &nbsp;your termination and, in any event, is described in the Plan and/or Option Agreement and &nbsp;generally, unless otherwise provided in the Option Agreement, will not exceed ninety (90) days &nbsp;from the date of termination (and in the event the you reside in the State of California, no less than &nbsp;thirty (30) days from the date of termination). However, in all events, your option will lapse if not &nbsp;exercised before the specified expiration of the option term. To the extent </span><span class="c0">not vested</span><span class="c1">, your option &nbsp;will terminate upon your termination of employment for any reason (unless your Option &nbsp;Agreement provides otherwise). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c214"><span class="c1">You will be deemed to continue in service for so long as you remain continuously &nbsp;employed with the Company. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c2">22. What happens to my options if I die or become disabled? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c308"><span class="c1">If your service with the Company terminates due to your death, the personal representative &nbsp;of your estate or the person or persons to whom the options are transferred by the provisions of &nbsp;your will or the laws of inheritance following your death may exercise each of those options for &nbsp;any or all Ordinary Shares for which the option was exercisable on the date your service with the &nbsp;Company terminated. Unless otherwise provided in the Option Agreement, the right to exercise &nbsp;each such option will normally lapse upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the option term or (ii) &nbsp;12 months following the date of your death (and in the event you reside in the State of California, &nbsp;no less than 6 months from the date of termination). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c345 c372"><span class="c1">If your service with the Company is terminated because you become permanently disabled &nbsp;(under the Plan, the term &ldquo;Disability&rdquo; means a disability as defined by Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), unless otherwise provided in the Option Agreement you will normally have a period of 12 &nbsp;months following the date of your termination (and in the event you reside in the State of &nbsp;California, no less than 6 months from the date of termination) during which you may exercise &nbsp;your options to the extent that they were exercisable upon your termination date. In no event, &nbsp;however, may you exercise any option after the expiration of the option term. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c2">23. What happens to my options if the Company is acquired or merged? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c418"><span class="c1">Except as provided in an Option Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, the Board &nbsp;may in its discretion take one or more of the following actions: (i) cause any or all outstanding &nbsp;options held by participants affected by the Change in Control to become vested and immediately &nbsp;exercisable, in whole or in part; (ii) cause any or all outstanding unvested options held by &nbsp;participants affected by the Change in Control to be cancelled without any consideration therefor; &nbsp;(iii) require any or all outstanding options held by a participant to be exercised in advance of the &nbsp;Change in Control and, to the extent not exercised, canceled; (iv) cancel any option in exchange &nbsp;for a substitute option; (v) cancel any option held by a participant affected by the Change in Control &nbsp;in exchange for cash and/or other substitute consideration based on the value of the cash and/or &nbsp;property that would have been received by the participant upon the exercise of the option in the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c412"><span class="c1">-6- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c398"><span class="c1">Change in Control, </span><span class="c26">provided, </span><span class="c1">that if that amount does not exceed the applicable exercise price, the &nbsp;option will be canceled without any payment of consideration therefor; (vi) condition the right to &nbsp;receive payment with respect to the options on execution of a release of claims and agreement to &nbsp;be bound by any definitive transaction document in connection with the Change in Control,; and/or &nbsp;(vii) take any other action necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of any definitive &nbsp;agreement controlling the terms and conditions of the Change in Control. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c92"><span class="c12">RESTRICTED SHARES/RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c185"><span class="c2">24. What are Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c307"><span class="c1">Restricted shares are Ordinary Shares that are subject to restrictions, generally, over a &nbsp;period of time. An RSU is the right to receive Ordinary Shares in the future, upon vesting. In &nbsp;each case, your right to receive unrestricted Ordinary Shares is subject to either a vesting schedule, &nbsp;a risk of forfeiture or other restrictions that will lapse upon the achievement of one or more service &nbsp;conditions, or achievement of performance goals or such other objectives as established and &nbsp;determined by the Administrator. Restricted shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged &nbsp;or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period or prior to the satisfaction of &nbsp;any other restrictions prescribed by the Administrator. Likewise, the conditions to which your &nbsp;RSUs are subject will be set forth by the Administrator in its RSU award agreement delivered to &nbsp;you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c162"><span class="c2">25.

The grant of options and other Awards under the Plan and the issuance of Ordinary &nbsp;Shares under the Plan are subject to the Company&rsquo;s procurement of all approvals and permits &nbsp;required by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Plan and the securities issuable &nbsp;thereunder. It is possible that such authorities could prevent the Company from granting options &nbsp;or from issuing Ordinary Shares under the Plan. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c417"><span class="c2">33.

State and local tax treatment, which is &nbsp;not discussed below, may vary from such Federal income tax treatment. You should consult with &nbsp;your own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of your particular transactions under the Plan. In &nbsp;addition, the following description is based upon the Code and existing laws, judicial decisions, &nbsp;administrative rulings, final and proposed regulations as in effect or existing on the date of this &nbsp;Plan Summary, all of which are subject to change, and assumes, with respect to any stock option, &nbsp;that the exercise price per share is no less than one-hundred percent (100%) of fair market value &nbsp;on the date of grant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c426"><span class="c95 c57">N</span><span class="c57 c76">othing contained in this discussion of certain federal income tax considerations is intended or</span><span class="c95 c57">&nbsp; </span><span class="c76 c57">written to be used, and nothing herein can be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding tax-related</span><span class="c95 c57">&nbsp; p</span><span class="c76 c57">enalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing, or recommending to</span><span class="c95 c57">&nbsp; </span><span class="c76 c57">another party any transactions or tax-related matters addressed herein.</span><span class="c95 c57">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c261"><span class="c1">As described below, the tax consequences of Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified &nbsp;Stock Options differ. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c352"><span class="c12">INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c135"><span class="c1">-9- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c2">34. Will the grant of an Incentive Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability to me? &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">No, not at the time of grant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c134"><span class="c2">35. Will the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability to &nbsp;me? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c283"><span class="c1">Generally not for ordinary income tax purposes. You will not recognize ordinary taxable &nbsp;income at the time the Incentive Stock Option is exercised. However, the amount by which the fair &nbsp;market value (at the time of exercise) of the purchased shares exceeds the exercise price paid for &nbsp;those shares will likely constitute an adjustment to your income for purposes of the alternative &nbsp;minimum tax (see the &ldquo;Alternative Minimum Tax&rdquo; section below). Also, if the Incentive Stock &nbsp;Option is exercised through a &ldquo;cashless exercise&rdquo; procedure, a portion of the option may be deemed &nbsp;disqualified as an Incentive Stock Option and would be taxed as a Non-Qualified Stock Option. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c434"><span class="c2">36. When will I be subject to Federal income tax on shares acquired under an Incentive Stock &nbsp;Option? </span></p><p class="c211"><span class="c1">Generally, you will recognize income in the year in which you make a disposition of the &nbsp;shares purchased under your Incentive Stock Option. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c244"><span class="c2">37. What constitutes a disposition of Incentive Stock Option shares? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c316"><span class="c1">A disposition of shares purchased under an Incentive Stock Option will occur in the event &nbsp;you transfer legal title to those shares, whether by sale, exchange or gift, or you deliver such shares &nbsp;in payment of the exercise price of any other Incentive Stock Option you hold. However, in &nbsp;general, a disposition will not occur if you engage in any of the following transactions: a transfer &nbsp;to your spouse, a transfer by bequest or inheritance upon your death or certain tax-free exchanges &nbsp;of the shares permitted under the Code. A &ldquo;cashless exercise&rdquo; of the Incentive Stock Option may &nbsp;constitute a disposition of Incentive Stock Option shares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c244"><span class="c2">38. How is my Federal income tax liability determined when I sell my shares? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c1">Your Federal income tax liability will depend upon whether you make a qualifying or &nbsp;disqualifying disposition of the shares purchased under your Incentive Stock Option. A qualifying &nbsp;disposition will occur if the sale or other disposition of the shares takes place more than two years &nbsp;after the date the Incentive Stock Option was granted and more than one year after the date the &nbsp;option was exercised for the particular shares involved in the disposition. A disqualifying &nbsp;disposition is any sale or other disposition made in which either of these minimum holding periods &nbsp;are not satisfied. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c244"><span class="c2">39. What if I make a qualifying disposition? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c299"><span class="c1">You will recognize a long-term capital gain equal to the excess of (i) the amount realized &nbsp;upon the sale or disposition over (ii) the exercise price paid for the shares. You will recognize a &nbsp;long-term capital loss if the amount realized is lower than the exercise price paid for the shares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c348"><span class="c1">-10- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c331"><span class="c1">Example: On October 1, 2022, you are granted an Incentive Stock Option for 1,000 shares &nbsp;with an exercise price of $15.00 per share. On November 1, 2024, you exercise this option when &nbsp;the market price is $25.00 per share. The purchased shares are held until December 1, 2025, when &nbsp;you sell them for $30.00 per share. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c310"><span class="c1">Because the disposition of the shares is made more than two years after the grant date of &nbsp;the 2022 Incentive Stock Option and more than one year after the option was exercised for the &nbsp;shares sold on December 1, 2025, the sale represents a qualifying disposition of such shares, and &nbsp;for Federal income tax purposes, you will recognize a long-term capital gain of $15.00 per share &nbsp;(</span><span class="c26">i.e.</span><span class="c1">, $30.00 sales price minus $15.00 exercise price). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c125"><span class="c2">40. What are the tax rules for a disqualifying disposition? </span></p><p class="c329"><span class="c1">Generally, when you make a disqualifying disposition of shares purchased under an &nbsp;Incentive Stock Option, you will recognize ordinary income at the time of the disposition in an &nbsp;amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares on the option exercise date &nbsp;over (ii) the exercise price paid for those shares. If the disqualifying disposition is effected by &nbsp;means of an arm&rsquo;s length sale or exchange with an unrelated party, the ordinary income will be &nbsp;limited to the amount by which (i) the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares or (ii) &nbsp;their fair market value on the exercise date, whichever is less, exceeds the exercise price paid for &nbsp;the shares. Provided that the Company is aware of the disqualifying disposition, the amount of &nbsp;your disqualifying disposition income will be reported by the Company on your W-2 wage &nbsp;statement for the year of disposition. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c201"><span class="c1">Any additional gain recognized upon the disqualifying disposition will be long-term capital &nbsp;gain, if the shares have been held for more than one year following the exercise date of the option. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c235"><span class="c1">Example: On October 1, 2022, you are granted an Incentive Stock Option for 1,000 shares &nbsp;with an exercise price of $15.00 per share. On November 1, 2024, this option is exercised when &nbsp;the market price is $25.00 per share. The purchased shares are held until March 1, 2025, when they &nbsp;are sold for $30.00 per share. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c226"><span class="c1">Because the disposition of the shares is made less than one year after the exercise date of &nbsp;the 2022 Incentive Stock Option, the sale represents a disqualifying disposition of the shares, and &nbsp;for Federal income tax purposes, the gain upon the sale will be divided into two components: &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c221"><span class="c1">Ordinary Income: You will recognize ordinary income in the amount of $10.00 per share, &nbsp;the excess of the $25.00 per share market price of the shares on the date the option was exercised &nbsp;over the $15.00 per share exercise price. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c196"><span class="c1">Capital Gain: You will also recognize a short-term (because the shares were held for one &nbsp;year or less after exercise) capital gain of $5.00 per share with respect to each share sold ($30.00 &nbsp;sale price less $25.00 fair market value at exercise). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c209"><span class="c1">In the event the shares purchased under an Incentive Stock Option are sold in a &nbsp;disqualifying disposition for less than the exercise price paid for those shares, you will not &nbsp;recognize any income but will recognize a capital loss equal to the excess of (i) the exercise price &nbsp;paid for the shares over (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of those shares. For example, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c225"><span class="c1">-11- &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">DocuSign Envelope ID: 7F22C731-1D29-428C-A48F-D9E7CECDE331</span></p><p class="c296 c339"><span class="c1">if the shares in the above example were sold for $13.00 per share in the disqualifying disposition, &nbsp;you would simply recognize a short-term capital loss of $2.00 per share. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c246"><span class="c2">41. What are the Federal tax consequences to the Company of a disposition of shares? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c167"><span class="c1">If you make a qualifying disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive &nbsp;Stock Option, then no income tax deduction may be taken by the Company with respect to such &nbsp;shares. Should you make a disqualifying disposition of such shares, then the Company will be &nbsp;entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income you recognize in &nbsp;connection with the disposition. The deduction will, in general, be allowed to the Company in the &nbsp;taxable year in which the disposition occurs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c319"><span class="c12">NONSTATUTORY OPTIONS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c312"><span class="c2">42. Will the grant of a Non-Qualified Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability to &nbsp;me? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c317 c387"><span class="c1">Generally no, not at the time of grant. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c2">43. Will the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option result in Federal income tax liability &nbsp;to me? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c389"><span class="c1">Normally, you will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the Non-Qualified &nbsp;Stock Option is exercised in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the &nbsp;purchased shares on the exercise date over (ii) the exercise price paid for those shares. This income &nbsp;will be reported by the Company on your W-2 wage statement for the year of exercise (or on a &nbsp;Form 1099 if you are not an employee), and you will be required to satisfy the tax withholding &nbsp;requirements applicable to this income. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c342"><span class="c2">44. Will I recognize additional income when I sell shares acquired under a Non-Qualified &nbsp;Stock Option? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c345 c415"><span class="c1">Yes. You will recognize a capital gain to the extent the amount realized upon the sale of &nbsp;such shares exceeds their fair market value at the time you recognized the ordinary income with &nbsp;respect to their acquisition. A capital loss will result to the extent the amount realized upon the &nbsp;sale is less than such fair market value. The gain or loss will be long-term if the shares are held for &nbsp;more than one year prior to the disposition and short-term if the shares are held for one year or &nbsp;less. The holding period normally starts at the time the Non-Qualified Stock Option is exercised. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c288"><span class="c2">45. What are the consequences of paying the exercise price of a Non-Qualified Stock Option &nbsp;in the form of Ordinary Shares previously acquired upon the exercise of employee options &nbsp;or through open-market purchases? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c1">You will not recognize any taxable income to the extent the Ordinary Shares received upon &nbsp;the exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Option equal in number the Ordinary Shares delivered in &nbsp;payment of the exercise price. For Federal income tax purposes, these newly-acquired shares will &nbsp;have the same basis and capital gain holding period as the delivered shares.

These additional shares will have a tax basis &nbsp;equal to such fair market value and a capital gain holding period measured (in general) from the &nbsp;exercise date. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c248"><span class="c2">46. What are the Federal tax consequences to the Company of the exercise of a Non-Qualified &nbsp;Stock Option? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c284"><span class="c1">The Company will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary &nbsp;income you recognize in connection with the exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Option. The &nbsp;deduction will, in general, be allowed for the taxable year of the Company in which you recognize &nbsp;such ordinary income. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c408"><span class="c12">OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c185"><span class="c2">47.

This will result in a recognition of taxable income to you on the date of the &nbsp;election; however, any further appreciation will be capital in nature. In the event the value &nbsp;declines, or in the event that your restricted shares are forfeited or do not vest, you will not be &nbsp;entitled to an ordinary loss, however. If you do not file an 83(b) election, at the expiration of the &nbsp;restriction period and the satisfaction of the forfeiture restrictions applicable to the restricted &nbsp;shares, you will recognize ordinary income, and the Company will generally be entitled to a &nbsp;corresponding deduction, equal to the fair market value of the Ordinary Shares at that time less the &nbsp;amount paid (if any) for such shares. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c1">48. </span><span class="c2">What are the tax consequences if I am granted RSUs? </span></p><p class="c194"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You will generally recognize ordinary income as and when the Ordinary Shares subject to the &nbsp;RSUs are issued you, in an amount equal to the fair market value of our Ordinary Shares issued &nbsp;(plus the amount (if any) of any cash received).
